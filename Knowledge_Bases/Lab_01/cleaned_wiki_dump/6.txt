The practice of system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders Åslund as manual management, commenting  "After Putin resumed presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as 'manual management' as Russians like to put it.

During Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs.

The period after 2012 saw mass protests against falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws.
