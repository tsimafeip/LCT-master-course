 First CDU–SPD grand coalition, 2005–2009 
The First Merkel cabinet was sworn in at 16 00 Central European Time CET on 22 November 2005. On 31 October 2005, after defeat of his favoured candidate for position of Secretary General of SPD, Franz Müntefering indicated that he would resign as party chairman, which he did in November. Ostensibly responding to this, Edmund Stoiber (CSU), who was originally nominated as Minister for Economics and Technology, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition, manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival.

The migrant crisis spurred right wing electoral preferences across Germany with Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of vote in 2017 German federal election. These developments prompted debates over reasons for increased right wing populism in Germany. Literature argued that increased right wing preferences are a result of European migrant crisis which has brought thousands of people, predominantly from Muslim countries to Germany, and spurred a perception among a share of Germans that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany. > journal last1 Lucassen first1 Geertje last2 Lubbers first2 Marcel title Who Fears What?
