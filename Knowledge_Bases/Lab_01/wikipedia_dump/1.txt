[[File:Paul Allen and Bill Gates at Lakeside School in 1970.jpg|thumb|Gates (right) with [[Paul Allen]] at [[Lakeside School (Seattle)|Lakeside School]] in 1970]]

At 13, he enrolled in the private [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside prep school]],{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=24}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Soundaian|first=S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYGcDwAAQBAJ&q=bill%20gates%20banned%20for%20summer%20pdp-10&pg=PA50|title=New Dimensions of Management|date=June 10, 2019|publisher=MJP Publisher|language=en}}</ref> where he wrote his first software program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates|title=Bill Gates {{!}} American computer programmer, businessman, and philanthropist|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the students.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=27}} Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.{{sfn|Gates|1996|p=12}} After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to [[Computer Center Corporation]] (CCC) which banned Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans, for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=34}}{{r|leibovich20001231}}

The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.{{r|leibovich20001231}} At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via [[Teleprinter|Teletype]], Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business.

The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.<ref name="leibovich20001231" />

Gates read the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' which demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], and he contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.<ref name="keyevents">{{cite web|title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft |format=.DOC |access-date=February 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |archive-date=February 26, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. MITS hired Allen,<ref name="thocp1">{{cite web|title=Microsoft history |publisher=The History of Computing Project |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |access-date=March 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211138/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archive-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator [[Ric Weiland]].<ref name="thocp1" /> They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.<ref name="thocp1" /> Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

[[Microsoft]]'s Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}} This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.<ref name="thocp1" /> The company moved from Albuquerque to [[Bellevue, Washington]] on January 1, 1979.<ref name="keyevents" />

Gates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years.

=== IBM partnership ===
[[IBM]], the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]],{{r |bunnell1982febmar}} after Bill Gates's mother, [[Mary Maxwell Gates]], mentioned Microsoft to [[John Opel]], IBM's [[CEO]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/mary-gates-64-helped-her-son-start-microsoft.html|title=Mary Gates, 64; helped her son start Microsoft|newspaper=The New York Times|agency=(obituary)|date=June 11, 1994|access-date=May 2, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420102313/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/mary-gates-64-helped-her-son-start-microsoft.html|archive-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes|first1=John Steele|last1=Gordon|first2=Michael|last2=Maiello|author-link1=John Steele Gordon|date=December 23, 2002|access-date=March 31, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029221703/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|archive-date=October 29, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using [[86-DOS]], an operating system similar to CP/M, that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patersontech.com/dos/microsoft-micronews.aspx |title=Father of DOS |work=Paterson Technology |access-date=October 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906120441/http://www.patersontech.com/dos/microsoft-micronews.aspx |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner.

The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of [[MS-DOS]] (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}} The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC.

Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.<ref name="keyevents" /><ref name="before microsoft">{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Allen|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/paul-allen-201105 |title=Microsoft's Odd Couple |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2011 |access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.<ref name="leibovich20001231" /> They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.<ref name="Gates Mourns Allen">{{Cite news |url=https://fortune.com/2018/10/16/bill-gates-paul-allen-death-microsoft/ |title=Bill Gates Mourns His Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen: 'Personal Computing Would Not Have Existed Without Him' |last=Detrick |first=Hallie |date=October 16, 2018 |work=Fortune |access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words such as "compete", "concerned", and "we". Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head.<ref name="GatesDepositionJudgeLaugh">{{cite news |access-date=April 10, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court |first=Elizabeth |last=Wasserman |work=CNN|date=November 17, 1998 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407052251/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |archive-date=April 7, 2013 }}</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' reported:

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a [[pandemic]], or [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] or [[bioterrorism]]." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=March 28, 2014|first=Jeff|last=Goodell|date=March 13, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317071201/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|archive-date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>

Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in [[sustainable energy]] technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|last=Wattles|first=Jackie|date=November 11, 2015|title=Bill Gates launches multi-billion dollar clean energy fund|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/29/news/economy/bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-coalition/index.html|access-date=December 12, 2020|website=CNN Money}}</ref> In 2011, he said: "If you gave me the choice between picking the next 10 presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, I'd pick the energy thing."<ref name="Wired 2011">{{cite magazine | title=Q&A: Bill Gates on the World's Energy Crisis | issue=7 | magazine=Wired | volume=19 | date=June 20, 2011 | url=https://www.wired.com/2011/06/mf-qagates/ | access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, he wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world's energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources. Global [[energy transitions]] have historically taken decades. He wrote, "I believe we can make this transition faster, both because the pace of innovation is accelerating, and because we have never had such an urgent reason to move from one source of energy to another."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gates|first=Bill|date=November 30, 2015|title=Energy Innovation: Why We Need It and How to Get It|url=https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Files/Energy/Energy_Innovation_Nov_30_2015|access-date=December 12, 2020|website=Gates Notes}}</ref> This rapid transition, according to Gates, would depend on increased government funding for basic research and financially risky private-sector investment, to enable innovation in diverse areas such as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[grid energy storage]] to facilitate greater use of solar and wind energy, and [[solar fuels]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|last1=Thornhill|first1=John|last2=Adams|first2=Christopher|date=June 25, 2015|title=Gates to double investment in renewable energy projects|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4f66ff5c-1a47-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996|access-date=December 12, 2020|website=[[Financial Times]]|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate.<ref name=mzyf /> During the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s (FTC) investigation of Microsoft in the 1990s, Gates was reportedly upset at Commissioner [[Dennis Yao]] for "float[ing] a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft's growing monopoly power". According to one source:<blockquote>Gates was vexed.

On February 18, 2021, after [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] had banned [[Donald Trump]] from their platforms as a result of the [[2020 United States presidential election]] which led to the [[2021 United States Capitol attack]], Gates said a permanent ban of Trump "would be a shame" and would be an "extreme measure".

In April 2021, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for [[COVID-19 vaccines]]. The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines. Tara Van Ho of the [[University of Essex]] stated, "Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections.

Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation". In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5&nbsp;billion to create the charitable [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|title=Gates foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523010101/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|archive-date=May 23, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|title=The Top Ten US Charitable Foundations|first=Robin|last=Toal|date=September 16, 2013|work=Funds For NGOs|publisher=Funds For NGOs, LLC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081521/http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|archive-date=April 7, 2014|url-status=live|access-date=April 6, 2014}}</ref> The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist|author=Cronin, Jon|date=January 25, 2005|access-date=April 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015134954/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|archive-date=October 15, 2007|url-status=live|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving|publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|archive-date=April 4, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20&nbsp;million to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2009/09/Bill-Gates-Carnegie-Mellon-University|title=Bill Gates – Carnegie Mellon University|website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/engage/partner/foundations/highlighted-partnerships/gates-center.html|title=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Builds Carnegie Mellon's Home for Computer Science |first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|website=cmu.edu|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>

== Books ==
Gates has written three books:
* ''[[The Road Ahead (Bill Gates book)|The Road Ahead]]'', written with Microsoft executive [[Nathan Myhrvold]] and journalist [[Peter Rinearson]], was published in November 1995. It summarized the implications of the personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global [[information superhighway]].
* ''[[Business @ the Speed of Thought]]'' was published in 1999, and discusses how business and technology are integrated, and shows how digital infrastructures and information networks can help to get an edge on the competition.
* ''[[How to Avoid a Climate Disaster]]'' (February 2021) presents what Gates learned in over a decade of studying climate change and investing in innovations to address climate problems.<ref name="Gates2021">Gates, Bill (2021).

=== Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein ===
A ''[[New York Times]]'' article reported that Gates's relationship with convicted sex offender [[Jeffrey Epstein]] started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein's conviction, and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with Melinda in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220101/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html |archive-date=January 1, 2022 |url-access=limited|title=Bill Gates Met With Jeffrey Epstein Many Times, Despite His Past|first1=Emily|last1=Flitter|first2=James B.|last2=Stewart|date=October 12, 2019|work=The New York Times}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: "His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me".<ref name = Flitter>{{Cite news|last1=Flitter|first1=Emily|last2=Goldstein|first2=Matthew|date=May 16, 2021|title=Long Before Divorce, Bill Gates Had Reputation for Questionable Behavior|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211228/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html |archive-date=December 28, 2021 |url-access=limited|access-date=May 22, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The depth of the friendship between Gates and Epstein is unclear. Gates generally commented about his relationship with Epstein that "I met him. I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him".<ref name = Guardian /> However, Gates visited Epstein "many times, despite [Epstein's] past".<ref name="auto1" />

It was reported that Epstein and Gates "discussed the Gates Foundation and philanthropy".<ref name="auto1" /> However, in an interview in 2019 Gates completely denied any connection between Epstein and the Gates Foundation or his philanthropy generally.<ref name = Guardian>Martin Pengelly & Rupert Neate (May 10, 2021), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/10/melinda-bill-gates-divorce-jeffrey-epstein-meetings "Melinda Gates began divorce moves at time Bill's meetings with Jeffrey Epstein revealed"], ''The Guardian:'' "Her meeting with divorce lawyers in October 2019 is said to have taken place at roughly the same time as a New York Times article detailed Bill's meetings with Epstein, which included an overnight stay at Epstein's New York mansion."</ref>  In August 2021, Gates said the reason he had meetings with Epstein was because Gates hoped Epstein could provide money for philanthropic work, though nothing came of the idea. Gates added, "It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there."<ref name="bbc5/8/2021" />

It has also been reported that Epstein and Gates met with [[Nobel Committee]] chair [[Thorbjørn Jagland]] at his residence in [[Strasbourg, France]] in March 2013 to discuss the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>Lee Brown (May 18, 2021), [https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/bill-gates-hoped-epstein-would-help-him-win-a-nobel-report/ "Bill Gates reportedly hoped Jeffrey Epstein would help him win a Nobel"], ''New York Post:'' "As well as staying at the multi-millionaire pervert's Upper East Side mansion, Gates joined Epstein in a trip to Europe in March 2013"</ref><ref>Tore Gjerstad & Gard Oterholm (October 2, 2020), [https://www.dn.no/magasinet/dokumentar/jeffrey-epstein/thorbjorn-jagland/terje-rod-larsen/bill-gates-and-jeffrey-epstein-met-with-nobel-committee-chair/2-1-885834 "Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein met with Nobel Committee chair"], ''[[Dagens Næringsliv]] Magasinet:'' "Not only did [[Thorbjørn Jagland|[Thorbjørn] Jagland]] meet Epstein, he hosted him at his lavish residence in [[Strasbourg, France]].

Gates's public image has changed over the years. At first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless "robber baron", a "nerd-turned-tycoon".<ref name=":7">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-21/bill-gates-s-carefully-curated-dad-geek-image-unravels-in-two-weeks|title=Bill Gates's Carefully Curated Geek Image Unravels in Two Weeks|last=Carr|first=Austin|date=May 21, 2021|work=Bloomberg News|access-date=July 25, 2021}}</ref> Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education. His image morphed from "tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior" to a "huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change.<ref name=":7" /> Still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing. Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted child sex trafficker [[Jeffrey Epstein]].<ref name = Flitter /> This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from "a lovable nerd who was out to save the world." to "a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health."<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|last1=Shephard|first1=Alex|date=June 4, 2021|title=Oligarch of the Month: Bill Gates|magazine=The New Republic|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/162598/bill-gates-oligarch-month-vaccines|access-date=July 23, 2021|issn=0028-6583}}</ref>

=== Religion ===
In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gates said in regard to his faith: "The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief."<ref name="God" /> In the same 2014 interview he also said: "I agree with people like [[Richard Dawkins]] that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm&nbsp;– not all&nbsp;– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs].
