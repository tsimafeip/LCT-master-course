It is the [[List of European countries by population|second most populous country]] in Europe after [[Russia]], and the most populous [[member state of the European Union]]. Germany is situated between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south; it covers an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, with a population of over 83 million within its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]]. Germany borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west. The nation's capital and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest city]] is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].

Various [[List of ancient Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. In the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]]. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation-state when [[Unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], the Empire was replaced by the semi-presidential [[Weimar Republic]].

The [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], [[World War II]], and [[the Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as [[West Germany]], and the German Democratic Republic, [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the [[European Union]], while the German Democratic Republic was a communist [[Eastern Bloc]] state and member of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. After the [[Peaceful Revolution|fall of communism]], [[German reunification]] saw the [[New states of Germany|former East German states]] join the Federal Republic of Germany on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]]—becoming a federal [[parliamentary republic]].

Germany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial, [[Science and technology in Germany|scientific and technological]] sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. As a [[developed country]], which [[List of countries by Human Development Index|ranks]] very high on the [[Human Development Index]], it [[Social security in Germany|offers social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care system]], environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G7]], the [[G20]], and the [[OECD]]. It has the [[List of World Heritage sites in Germany|third-greatest number]] of [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s.

Most of Germany has a [[temperate]] climate, ranging from [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] in the north to [[Continental climate|continental]] in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/Climate|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Germany: Climate|access-date=23 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323124307/https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/Climate|archive-date=23 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} (Federal Diet) and {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}} (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The {{lang|de|Bundestag}} is elected through [[direct election]]s using the [[mixed-member proportional representation]] system. The members of the {{lang|de|Bundesrat}} represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.<ref name="CIA" /> The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the {{lang|de|[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]}} (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} and the {{lang|de|Bundesrat}}; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the [[rule of law]], are valid in perpetuity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf |title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany |date=October 2010 |website=Deutscher Bundestag |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619180331/https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf |archive-date=19 June 2017 |access-date=14 April 2011}}</ref>

The [[President of Germany|president]], currently [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]], is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers.

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] have also been junior partners in [[coalition government]]s. Since 2007, the left-wing populist party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] has been a staple in the German {{lang|de|Bundestag}}, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the [[2017 German federal election]], the right-wing populist [[Alternative for Germany]] gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-political-parties-cdu-csu-spd-afd-fdp-left-party-greens-what-you-need-to-know/a-38085900|website=DW|date=7 June 2019|title=Germany's political parties CDU, CSU, SPD, AfD, FDP, Left party, Greens – what you need to know|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214204745/https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-political-parties-cdu-csu-spd-afd-fdp-left-party-greens-what-you-need-to-know/a-38085900|archive-date=14 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/german-election-results-exit-poll-2017-live-latest-afd-mps-merkel-alternative-a7964796.html|website=The Independent|title=German elections: Far-right wins MPs for first time in half a century|last=Stone|first=Jon|date=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227224650/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/german-election-results-exit-poll-2017-live-latest-afd-mps-merkel-alternative-a7964796.html|archive-date=27 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]] has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky Brothers]] were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Potsdam]] was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world.

Director [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as {{lang|de|[[Rubble film|Trümmerfilm]]}} (rubble film).
