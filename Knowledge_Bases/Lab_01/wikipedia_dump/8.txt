Musk was born to a Canadian mother and [[White South Africans|White South African]] father, and raised in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]]. He briefly attended the [[University of Pretoria]] before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid [[conscription]]. He was enrolled at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] and transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in [[economics]] and [[physics]]. He moved to California in 1995 to attend [[Stanford University]] but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company [[Zip2]] with his brother [[Kimbal Musk|Kimbal]]. The startup was acquired by [[Compaq]] for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank [[X.com]], which merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000 to form [[PayPal]]. The company was bought by [[eBay]] in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an [[aerospace]] manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and [[Chief technology officer|Chief Engineer]]. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create [[SolarCity]], a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became [[Tesla Energy]]. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes [[friendly artificial intelligence]]. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a [[neurotechnology]] company focused on developing [[brain‚Äìcomputer interface]]s, and founded The Boring Company, a [[tunnel construction]] company. Musk has proposed the [[Hyperloop]], a high-speed [[vactrain]] transportation system.

Musk has been criticized for his unscientific stances and controversial statements. In 2018, he was sued by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreeing to limitations on his [[Twitter]] usage. In 2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the [[Tham Luang cave rescue]]. Musk has also been criticized for spreading [[COVID-19 misinformation|misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic]] and for [[Views of Elon Musk|his other views]] on such matters as [[artificial intelligence]], [[cryptocurrency]], and [[public transport]].

In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8&nbsp;million, which Musk rejected.

Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine on [[CNN]] as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk "had no conception of what the cave passage was like" and "can stick his submarine where it hurts". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as "pedo guy".<ref name="Levin18">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/15/elon-musk-british-diver-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-twitter|title=Elon Musk calls British diver in Thai cave rescue a 'pedo' in baseless attack|last1=Levin|first1=Sam|date=July 15, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|access-date=July 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803133851/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/15/elon-musk-british-diver-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-twitter|archive-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref> He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, "Stay tuned jackass."<ref name="Levin18" /> On July 16, Unsworth stated that he was considering legal action.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44846945|title=British caver 'could sue' Elon Musk|date=July 16, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=July 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200624152041/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44846945|archive-date=June 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/16/british-diver-in-thai-cave-rescue-stunned-after-attack-by-elon-musk|title=British cave diver considering legal action over Elon Musk's 'pedo' attack|last1=Safi|first1=Michael|date=July 16, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=July 16, 2018|last2=Levin|first2=Sam|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803151555/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/16/british-diver-in-thai-cave-rescue-stunned-after-attack-by-elon-musk|archive-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref>

In December 2021, when prompted for his opinion about the [[virtual reality]] (VR) driven [[metaverse]], Musk said that he was "unable to see a compelling metaverse situation" and further remarked that "I think we're far from disappearing into the metaverse. This sounds just kind of buzzword-y. [...] Sure you can put a TV on your nose. I'm not sure that makes you 'in the metaverse'.

{{Blockquote|text="There is this premise that good things must be somehow painful. I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time."

"It's a pain in the ass, that's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want."

When the audience member responded that public transportation seemed to work in Japan, Musk shot back, "What, where they cram people in the subway? That doesn't sound great."}}

His comments have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and [[urban planning]] experts, which have pointed out that public transportation in dense [[urban area]]s is more economical, more energy efficient and requires much less space than private cars.<ref>{{cite news|last=LeVine|first=Steve|date=December 28, 2017|title=Elon Musk's mean Twitter persona|work=Axios|url=https://www.axios.com/elon-musks-mean-twitter-persona-2519102985.html|url-status=live|access-date=October 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229113747/https://www.axios.com/elon-musks-mean-twitter-persona-2519102985.html|archive-date=December 29, 2017}}</ref><ref name="guardian54">{{cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|date=December 21, 2017|title='I met my wife on a train platform': Twitter responds to Elon Musk with positive public transport stories|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/elon-musk-public-transport-transit-painful-twitter|access-date=October 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827033023/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/elon-musk-public-transport-transit-painful-twitter|archive-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=":14" />
