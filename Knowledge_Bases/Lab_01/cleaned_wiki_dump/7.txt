Career
Early writing career
Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was "The Hero", sold to Galaxy Science Fiction Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for Hugo Award > web title With Morning Comes Mistfall  url  publisher Hugo Awards  access date May 22, 2012    archive url  archive date March 3, 2012  > and Nebula Awards was "With Morning Comes Mistfall", published in 1973 in Analog Science Fiction and Fact Analog magazine. In 1975 his story "...for a single yesterday" about a post apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in Epoch (anthology) Epoch, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, Dying of Light (1977 novel) Dying of Light, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year enormous success of Star Wars (film) Star Wars had a huge impact on publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold novel for same amount he would make in three years of teaching. > web url R.R. Martin  The Complete Rolling Stone Interview Mikal Gilmore date June 13, 2014 website rollingstone.com >

The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit, but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming full time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with American chess craze which followed Bobby Fischer's victory in World Chess Championship 1972 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer. > news url RR Martin on success, chess and wrath of superfans website independent.co.uk > > web url & Times of George R.R.

Teaching
In mid 1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised science fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but to write in field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for Hugo Award and twice for Nebula Award for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in Novel for their Children of Dusk. > web title 1997 Bram Stoker Award Nominees & Winners [presented in 1998] url Writers Association access date July 22, 2020 >

In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College).

Concentration on writing
While he enjoyed teaching, sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full time writer. When his wife graduated from Clarke in 1979, he resigned from his job, and being tired of hard winters in Dubuque, they moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1979, which they had "fallen in love with" after a visit year before on their way to 36th World Science Fiction Convention worldcon in Phoenix. > magazine url R.R.

Martin is a member of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice president from 1996 to 1998.citation needed date February 2015 In 1976, for Kansas City's MidAmeriCon, 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized first Hugo Losers' Party for benefit of all past and present Hugo losing writers on evening following convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and novella The Storms of Windhaven, co written with Lisa Tuttle.  name "Locusmag"> news url  The Locus title  Index to SF Awards access date  August 14, 2012  archive url  May 5, 2009 df  mdy all > Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm".

In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction horror hybrids in late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered Sandkings (novelette) Sandkings (1979) best known of these. Another was novella Nightflyers (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, Nightflyers (film) Nightflyers, with a screenplay co written by Martin. > web url NIGHTFLYER Flies Again grrm date November 27, 2017 website livejournal.com > Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate film's small budget.  name "NPR2012"> web   url   title 'Thrones' Author George R.R.

In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled Fevre Dream set in 19th century on Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in Fevre Dream vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised Fevre Dream for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote  "This is without question one of greatest vampire novels of all time".  name "D'Amassa pages 388 390">D'Amassa, Don "Martin, George" pages 388 390 from St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers edited by David Pringle, Detroit  St. James Press, 1997 page 390. > Martin followed up Fevre Dream with another horror novel, The Armageddon Rag (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of The Armageddon Rag "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at time", he recalled, and made him consider going into real estate instead. >[This failure nearly made 'Game of Thrones' creator George R.R. Martin stop writing and go into real estate] >

In 1984, new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like Solomon Kane, Elric, Nicholas van Rijn and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with writing of his next book, never completed novel Black and White and Red All Over, which occupied most of his writing time same year. But after failure of The Armageddon Rag, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in Tuf Voyaging, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt The Armageddon Rag into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became producer for revival of The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series) The Twilight Zone, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.  name "berwick20120601"> news   url   title Lunch with FT  George RR Martin   work Financial Times   date June 1, 2012   access date June 1, 2012   author Berwick, Isabel > > book url A RRetrospective George R.

He worked on scripts and created show's "Ped Xing" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, American Broadcasting Company ABC show was cancelled in middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer producer on new dramatic fantasy series Beauty and Beast (1987 TV series) Beauty and Beast; in 1989, he became show's co supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.

In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in Portraits of His Children. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book series editor, this time overseeing development of multi author Wild Cards book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post–World War II humanity gains superpowers after release of an alien engineered virus; new titles are published in ongoing series from Tor Books.

This story has a strong sense of Depression (mood) melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M.

 > However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of "realness" and "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) Peripeteia consequential plot twists that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out <blockquote>There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.  name "TMWagner" /></blockquote>Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire  "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys Targaryen Daenerys, Arya Stark Arya and Jaime Lannister Kingslayer will keep readers turning even vast number of pages contained in this volume, for author, like J. R. R. Tolkien Tolkien or Robert Jordan Jordan, makes us care about their fates." >[Review of A Storm of Swords] by Publishers Weekly > Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached reader has become.

In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over reliance on magic and a simplistic "good and evil good versus evil" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from prevalent "heroic knights and chivalry" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of Rings. He specifically critiques oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as "Disneyland Middle Ages", > news  url   magazine Time   date April 18, 2011   title GRRM Interview Part 2  Fantasy and History > which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements.
