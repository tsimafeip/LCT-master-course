He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic tac toe that allowed users to play games against computer. Gates was fascinated by machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.sfn Gates 1996 p 12 After Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including Digital Equipment Corporation DEC Programmed Data Processor PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP 10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans, for summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in operating system to obtain free computer time.sfn Manes 1994 p 34r leibovich20001231

The four students formed Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.r leibovich20001231 At end of ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using system remotely via Teleprinter Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on system, including Fortran, Lisp (programming language) Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when company went out of business.

The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate school's class scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have program ready for their senior year. Towards end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of saddest days of his life.

Gates read January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for platform.  name "keyevents"> web title Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information  Key Events in Microsoft History  url  publisher Microsoft  format .DOC  access date February 18, 2008  archive url  archive date February 26, 2008    > In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts (computers) Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,  name "thocp1"> web title Microsoft history  publisher The History of Computing Project  url  access date March 31, 2008  archive url  archive date May 14, 2008    > and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque.

Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high quality software.Sfn  Manes 1994 p 81 This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.  name "thocp1" /> The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.  name "keyevents" />

IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system.

It was prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to leading software company in world.

 Religion 
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates said in regard to his faith  "The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce inequity in world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief."  name "God" /> In same 2014 interview he also said  "I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of realm&nbsp;– not all&nbsp;– that religion used to fill. But mystery and beauty of world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about.
