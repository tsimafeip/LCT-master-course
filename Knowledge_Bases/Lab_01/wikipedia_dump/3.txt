Merkel was born in [[Hamburg]] in then-[[West Germany]], moving to [[East Germany]] as an infant when her father, a [[Lutheran]] clergyman, received a pastorate in [[Perleberg]]. She obtained a doctorate in [[quantum chemistry]] in 1986 and worked as a [[research scientist]] until 1989.<ref name=covid19-atlantic/> Merkel entered politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989]], briefly serving as deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected [[Government of East Germany]] led by [[Lothar de Maizière]]. Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, Merkel was elected to the [[Bundestag]] for the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. As the protégée of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], Merkel was appointed as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Minister for Women and Youth]] in 1991, later becoming [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] in 1994. After the CDU lost the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]], Merkel was elected CDU General Secretary, before becoming the party's first female leader and the first female Leader of the Opposition two years later, in the aftermath of a [[CDU donations scandal|donations scandal]] that toppled [[Wolfgang Schäuble]].

Following the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], Merkel was appointed to succeed [[Gerhard Schröder]] as Chancellor of [[Germany]], leading a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Merkel was the first woman to be elected as Chancellor, and the first Chancellor since reunification to have been raised in the former East Germany. At the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]], the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).<ref name="BBCnewterm2">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm |title=Germany's Merkel begins new term |access-date=1 November 2009 |date=28 October 2009 |publisher=BBC |archive-date=31 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031061627/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm |url-status = live}}</ref> At the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], Merkel's CDU won a landslide victory with 41.5% of the vote and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag.<ref name="cwn">{{cite web |title=German Chancellor Angela Merkel makes a hat-trick win in 2013 Elections |url=http://www.classworld.us/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-makes-a-hat-trick-win-in-2013-elections/ |access-date=23 September 2013 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926184317/http://www.classworld.us/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-makes-a-hat-trick-win-in-2013-elections/ |archive-date=26 September 2013}}</ref> At the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]], Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time; Merkel formed a third grand coalition with the SPD and was sworn in for a joint-record fourth term as Chancellor on 14 March 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/angela-merkel-sworn-in-for-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor |title=Angela Merkel faces multiple challenges in her fourth term |first1=Philip |last1=Oltermann |first2=Kate |last2=Connolly |date=14 March 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=14 March 2018 |archive-date=14 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314131346/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/angela-merkel-sworn-in-for-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor |url-status=live }}</ref>

In [[Foreign policy of the Angela Merkel government|foreign policy]], Merkel has emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and [[NATO]], and strengthening [[Transatlantic Economic Council|transatlantic economic relations]]. In 2008, Merkel served as [[President of the European Council]] and played a central role in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and the [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]]. Merkel played a crucial role in managing the global [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and the [[European debt crisis]]. She negotiated the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan]] focusing on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the [[Great Recession]]. In domestic policy, Merkel's ''[[Energiewende]]'' program has focused on future [[energy development]], seeking to phase out [[nuclear power in Germany]], reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]], and increase [[renewable energy]] sources. Reforms to the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' which abolished conscription, [[health care reform]], and her government's response to the 2010s [[European migrant crisis]] and the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany]] were major issues during her chancellorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11984378/Angela-Merkel-faces-outright-rebellion-within-her-own-party-over-refugee-crisis.html|title=Angela Merkel faces outright rebellion within her own party over refugee crisis|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=24 January 2016|archive-date=25 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125232715/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11984378/Angela-Merkel-faces-outright-rebellion-within-her-own-party-over-refugee-crisis.html|url-status=live}}</ref> She served as the [[List of G7 leaders|senior G7 leader]] from 2011 to 2012 and again from 2014 to 2021.

== Education and scientific career ==
At school Merkel learned to speak Russian fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and mathematics. She was the best in her class in mathematics and Russian, and completed her school education with the best possible average [[Abitur]] grade 1.0.<ref>{{cite book|title=Angela Merkel|last=Langguth|first=Gerd|date=August 2005|publisher=DTV|isbn=3-423-24485-2|page=50|language=de|author-link=Gerd Langguth}}</ref>

Merkel continued her education at [[Leipzig University|Karl Marx University, Leipzig]], where she studied [[physics]] from 1973 to 1978.<ref name="Ruetter, Werner, Who's Afraid of Merkel" /> While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the [[Moritzbastei]], a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the [[East Germany|GDR]] of that period, and initially resisted by the university. With backing of the local leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the project was allowed to proceed.<ref>{{cite news|language=de |work=Der Spiegel |date=27 March 2009 |url=https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/legendaere-clubs-a-949765.html |first=Torsten |last=Reitler |title=Drogenwahn auf der Dauerbaustelle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113154152/http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/3852/drogenwahn_auf_der_baustelle.html |archive-date=13 January 2010 |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref>

Near the end of her studies, Merkel sought an assistant professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree [[Unofficial collaborator (Stasi)|to report]] on her colleagues to officers of the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]]. Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy.<ref name="Crawford, Alan Czuczka, Tony" />

Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for [[Physical Chemistry]] of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Adlershof|Berlin-Adlershof]] from 1978 to 1990.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0803-017, Lothar de Maiziere und Angela Merkel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Lothar de Maizière]] and Merkel, 1990]]
The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989 served as the catalyst for Merkel's political career.<!--<ref name="Hugger, Justin, 10 moments that define" />--> Although she did not participate in the crowd celebrations the night the wall came down, one month later Merkel became involved in the growing democracy movement, joining the new party ''Demokratischer Aufbruch'' (DA, or in English "[[Democratic Beginning]]").<ref name="Hugger, Justin, 10 moments that define" /> Party Leader [[Wolfgang Schnur]] appointed her as press spokeswoman of the party in February 1990. However, Schnur was revealed to have worked for the [[Stasi]] just a few weeks ahead of the [[1990 East German general election|first (and only) multi-party election in 1990]] and was later expelled from the party. The [[Democratic Beginning|DA]] sunk as a result, only managing to elect four members to the [[Volkskammer]]. However, because the DA was a member party of the [[Alliance for Germany]], which won the election in a landslide, the DA was included in the government coalition. Merkel was therefore appointed deputy spokesperson of the new and last pre-[[German reunification|unification]] government under [[Lothar de Maizière]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Angela Merkel|last=Langguth|first=Gerd|date=August 2005|publisher=DTV|isbn=3-423-24485-2|location=Munich|pages=112–137|language=de|orig-year=2005}}</ref>

=== Minister for Women and Youth, 1991–1994 ===
In the [[1990 German federal election|German federal election of 1990]], the first to be held following reunification, Merkel successfully stood for election to the [[Bundestag]] in the parliamentary constituency of [[Stralsund&nbsp;– Nordvorpommern&nbsp;– Rügen (electoral district)|Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen]] in north [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.focus.de/regional/mecklenburg-vorpommern/kommunen-merkel-im-landkreis-vorpommern-ruegen-erwartet_id_6455183.html|agency=dpa|title=Merkel wirbt für gute Finanzausstattung der Kommunen|date=6 January 2010|work=Focus Online|access-date=29 April 2017|language=de|archive-date=9 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109094717/http://www.focus.de/regional/mecklenburg-vorpommern/kommunen-merkel-im-landkreis-vorpommern-ruegen-erwartet_id_6455183.html|url-status=live}}</ref> She received the crucial backing of then-influential CDU minister and state party chairman [[Günther Krause]].

In November 1991, Merkel, with the support of the federal CDU, ran for the leadership of the neighboring CDU in Brandenburg. She lost to Ulf Finke; this has been the only election to date Merkel has lost.

After the [[Helmut Kohl|Kohl Government]] was [[1998 German federal election|defeated at the 1998 election]], Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]],<ref name=":0" /> a key position as the party was no longer part of the federal government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Following a [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|party funding scandal]] that compromised many leading figures of the CDU – including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] – Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him.<ref name=":0" />

Following Merkel's election as CDU Leader, the CDU was not able to win in subsequent state elections. As early as February 2001 her rival [[Friedrich Merz]] had made clear he intended to become [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s main challenger in the [[2002 German federal election|2002 election]].

==== Some successes ====
After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the [[Bundestag]]; Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel. Stoiber voted for Merkel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/opposition-meltdown-the-great-disintegration-act-a-324300.html|title=Opposition meltdown: The great disintegration act|work=Der Spiegel|date=22 October 2004|access-date=28 November 2015|archive-date=10 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010140141/http://www.spiegel.de/international/opposition-meltdown-the-great-disintegration-act-a-324300.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Merkel supported a substantial [[reform movement|reform]] agenda for Germany's economic and social system, and was considered more pro-market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies could not easily control labour costs when business is slow.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,249207,00.html |title=Merkel fordert längere Arbeitszeit |language=de |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=18 May 2003 |access-date=27 August 2011 |archive-date=13 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613150234/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0%2C1518%2C249207%2C00.html |url-status = live}}</ref>

Merkel argued that Germany should phase out [[nuclear power]] less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html|title=Merkel: Nuclear phase-out is wrong|newspaper=[[World Nuclear News]]|date=10 June 2008|access-date=27 August 2011|archive-date=16 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616040957/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-nuclear-phaseout-explained/a-39171204 |date=15 June 2017 |first=Rebecca |last=Staudenmaier |title=Germany's nuclear phase-out explained |work=DW |access-date=27 July 2019 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824011914/https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-nuclear-phaseout-explained/a-39171204 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], describing it as "unavoidable" and accusing Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of [[anti-Americanism]]. She criticised the government's support for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] and favoured a "[[privileged partnership]]" instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.4324/9780203847060  |editor-first=Marlies |editor-last=Casier |editor-first2=Joost |editor-last2=Jongerden |title=Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey |year=2010 |page=110 |isbn=978-1-136-93867-2 }}</ref>

==== 2005 national election ====
On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in the [[2005 German federal election|2005 national elections]]. Her party began the campaign with a 21-point lead over the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in national opinion polls, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the incumbent.

=== First CDU–SPD grand coalition, 2005–2009 ===
The [[First Merkel cabinet]] was sworn in at 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]] on 22 November 2005. On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, [[Franz Müntefering]] indicated that he would resign as party chairman, which he did in November. Ostensibly responding to this, [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU), who was originally nominated as Minister for Economics and Technology, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005. The [[Second Merkel cabinet|second Cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 28 October 2009.<ref name="cabinet2009">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4836127,00.html |title=Merkel's new cabinet sworn in |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=30 October 2009 |access-date=1 November 2009 |last=Penfold |first=Chuck |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171452/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C%2C4836127%2C00.html |archive-date=1 June 2010 }}</ref>

On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a [[2005 German federal election|stalemate election]] that resulted in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]. The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.<ref>{{cite news|date=14 November 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm |title=German parties back new coalition |archive-date=11 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111191948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm |url-status = live}}</ref> Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm |title=Merkel becomes German chancellor |date=22 November 2005 |work=BBC News |archive-date=9 December 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051209014210/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm |url-status = live}}</ref>

Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing [[VAT]] (from 16 to 19%), [[social insurance]] contributions and the top rate of [[income tax]].<ref>{{cite news|title=German coalition poised for power |date=11 November 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125031009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |archive-date=25 November 2005 |url-status = live}}</ref>

In November 2015, there were talks inside the governing coalition to stop family unification for migrants for two years, and to establish "Transit Zones" on the border and – for migrants with low chances to get asylum approved – to be housed there until their application is approved. The issues are in conflict between the CSU who favoured those new measures and threatened to leave the coalition without them, and the SPD who opposes them; Merkel agreed to the measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-coalition-split-on-transit-zones/av-18824248|title=Germany: Coalition split on transit zones|work=DW.COM|access-date=4 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104013756/http://www.dw.com/en/germany-coalition-split-on-transit-zones/av-18824248|archive-date=4 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] prompted a reevaluation of German officials' stance on the EU's policy toward migrants.<ref name=ParisAttacksMigrants>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/14/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-migrants-rising-tensions.html|title=Paris Attacks Provoke Fresh Migrant Fears in Europe|last1=Emric|first1=Eldar|last2=Nellas|first2=Demetri|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 November 2015|access-date=14 November 2015|archive-date=18 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118052008/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/14/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-migrants-rising-tensions.html|url-status=live}}</ref> There appeared to be a consensus among officials, with the exception of Merkel, that a higher level of scrutiny was needed in vetting migrants with respect to their mission in Germany.<ref name=ParisAttacksMigrants/> However, while not officially limiting the influx numerically, Merkel tightened asylum policy in Germany.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/world/europe/merkel-whilerefusing-to-halt-migrant-influx-works-to-limit-it.html?ref=Europe|title=Merkel, While Refusing to Halt Migrant Influx, Works to Limit It|author=Alison Smale|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 November 2015|access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

In October 2016, Merkel travelled to [[Mali]] and [[Niger]].

The migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the [[2017 German federal election]]. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Literature argued that the increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis which has brought thousands of people, predominantly from Muslim countries to Germany, and spurred a perception among a share of Germans that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucassen|first1=Geertje|last2=Lubbers|first2=Marcel|title=Who Fears What?

Merkel's foreign policy has focused on strengthening European cooperation and international trade agreements. Merkel has been widely described as the ''de facto'' leader of the [[European Union]] throughout her tenure as Chancellor.

In [[2015 G20 Antalya summit|2015]], with the absence of [[Stephen Harper]], Merkel became the only leader to have attended every [[G20]] meeting since the first in [[2008 G20 Washington summit|2008]], having been present at a record [[List of G20 summits|fifteen summits]] as of [[2021 G20 Rome summit|2021]].

== Comparisons ==
[[File:Press conference EU-Mercosul on June 26, 2019 (VII).jpg|thumb|Merkel, often depicted as the unofficial leader of Europe, at the [[2019 G20 Osaka summit]]]]
As a woman who is a politician from a centre-right party and also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to late 20th century British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] (Thatcher also had a science degree from [[Oxford University]] in chemistry). Some have referred to her as "Iron Lady", "Iron Girl", and even "The Iron Frau", all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was "The Iron Lady". Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |title=Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher? |newspaper=Slate |date=5 July 2005 |last=Risen |first=Clay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428223123/http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |archive-date=28 April 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref> Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the nickname ''"Mutti"'' (a German familiar form of "mother").
She has also been called the "Iron Chancellor", in reference to [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/21540283 |title=The new iron chancellor |date=26 November 2009 |newspaper=The Economist |archive-date=24 November 2011 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124193154/http://www.economist.com/node/21540283  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hillary is America's Merkel, but not in the way Trump thinks |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=18 August 2016 |last=Barro |first=Josh |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-merkel-donald-trump-2016-8 |access-date=20 December 2016 |archive-date=22 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622061730/http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-merkel-donald-trump-2016-8 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to have grown up in the former East Germany (though she was born in the West),<ref>{{cite book|last=Langguth|first=Gerd|title=Angela Merkel |date=August 2005|publisher=DTV|location=Munich|language=de|isbn=3-423-24485-2|page=10}}</ref> and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. While she studied physics, her predecessors studied law, business or history, among other professions.
