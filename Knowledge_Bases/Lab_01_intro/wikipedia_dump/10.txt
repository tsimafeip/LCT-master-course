In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager [[Massimiliano Allegri]], depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3779061/juventus-twin-towers-of-ronaldomandzukic-to-provide-a-unique-test-for-atleticos-stingy-defence |title=Juventus' twin towers of Ronaldo, Mandzukic to provide a unique test for Atletico's stingy defence |publisher=ESPN FC |first1=Michael |last1=Cox |date=19 February 2019 |access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="FreeRole">{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/3958370/ronaldos-free-role-with-juventus-is-a-headache-for-sarri-how-can-he-work-around-his-star |title=Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri.
