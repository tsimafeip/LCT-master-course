'''George Raymond Richard Martin'''<ref name="middlename" /> (born '''George Raymond Martin'''; September 20, 1948),<ref name="confirmation" /> also known as '''GRRM''',<ref name="grrm" /> is an American novelist, screenwriter, television producer and [[short story]] writer. He is the author of the series of [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]] novels ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', which were adapted into the [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]-winning [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' (2011–2019). He also helped create the ''[[Wild Cards]]'' anthology series, and contributed [[worldbuilding]] for the 2022 video game ''[[Elden Ring]]''.

In 2005, [[Lev Grossman]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called Martin "the American [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]",<ref name=time_american_tolkien>{{cite news|last=Grossman |first=Lev |author-link=Lev Grossman |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1129596,00.html |title=Books: The American Tolkien |magazine=Time |date=November 13, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229125934/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1129596%2C00.html |archive-date=December 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 2, 2014 }}</ref> and in 2011, he was included on the annual [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world.<ref name="time100pat">{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066129,00.html|title=The 2011 TIME 100: George R.R.

==Early life==
George Raymond Martin (he adopted the [[confirmation name]] Richard at 13 years old)<ref name="confirmation" /> was born on September 20, 1948,<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitor|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 20–27, 2013|issue=1277/1278|page=36}}</ref> in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite web| url= http://georgerrmartin.com/life/ |title=Life & Times of George R.R.

His mother's family had once been wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the [[Great Depression]], something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family's dock and house. It made him feel that even if they were poor, they came from greatness that had been taken away from them.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8NNyZH2rgM&t=185s George R.R.

However, while he also believed he was a quarter [[Italians|Italian]] because of who he was told was his paternal grandfather, a DNA test on the show confirmed his Irish and other ancestries but excluded any Italian ancestry, showing instead he is approximately a quarter [[Ashkenazi Jewish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/game-of-thrones-creator-george-r-r-martin-discovers-hes-a-quarter-jewish/|title=Game of Thrones creator George R.R.

The family first lived in a house on Broadway belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal [[housing project]] near the Bayonne docks.<ref name=theheartofasmall /> During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/george-rr-martin/|title=NJM Q&A: George R.R.

He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".{{r|berwick20120601}} Martin had a habit of starting "endless stories" that he never completed, as they did not turn out as well on paper as he had imagined them.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-18|title=George RR Martin: 'Game of Thrones finishing is freeing, I'm at my own pace'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/18/george-rr-martin-interview-game-of-thrones-at-own-pace-now|access-date=2021-02-17|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later [[Marist High School (New Jersey)|Marist High School]]. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by [[Marvel Comics]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Rutkoff, Aaron|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/07/08/garden-state-tolkien-qa-with-george-r-r-martin/ |title=Garden State Tolkien: Q&A With George R.R.

==Career==
===Early writing career===
Martin began selling science fiction [[short stories]] professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was "The Hero", sold to ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the [[Hugo Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=With Morning Comes Mistfall |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1974-hugo-awards/ |publisher=Hugo Awards |access-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303090430/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1974-hugo-awards/ |archive-date=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> and [[Nebula Award]]s was "[[With Morning Comes Mistfall]]", published in 1973 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' magazine. In 1975 his story "...for a single yesterday" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in ''[[Epoch (anthology)|Epoch]]'', a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, ''[[Dying of the Light (1977 novel)|Dying of the Light]]'', was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-rolling-stone-interview-20140613|title=George R.R. Martin: The Complete Rolling Stone Interview|first=Mikal|last=Gilmore|date=June 13, 2014|website=rollingstone.com}}</ref>

The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit, but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed [[Bobby Fischer]]'s victory in the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 world chess championship]]. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/song-of-ice-and-fire-author-george-rr-martin-on-success-chess-and-the-wrath-of-superfans-9652448.html|title=George RR Martin on success, chess and the wrath of superfans|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/life/|title=Life & Times of George R.R. Martin|website=www.georgerrmartin.com}}</ref>

===Teaching===
In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor [[George Guthridge]] from [[Dubuque, Iowa]], at a [[science fiction convention]] in [[Milwaukee]]. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]) not only to give [[speculative fiction]] a second look, but to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the [[Nebula Award]] for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the [[Bram Stoker Award]] for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their ''Children of the Dusk''.<ref>{{cite web|title=1997 Bram Stoker Award Nominees & Winners [presented in 1998]|url=http://www.thebramstokerawards.com/uncategorized/1997-bram-stoker-award-winners-nominees/|website=Horror Writers Association|access-date=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at [[Clarke University]] (then Clarke College). Martin "wasn't making enough money to stay alive" from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.press-citizen.com/story/entertainment/go-iowa-city/2014/05/23/westeros-iowa/9517663/ |author=Munson, Kyle|title=Before Westeros, there was Iowa|work=[[Iowa City Press-Citizen]]|date= May 23, 2014}}</ref> From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.<ref name="Contemporary Authors">{{cite web|title=George R.

===Concentration on writing===
While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author [[Tom Reamy]] in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. When his wife graduated from Clarke in 1979, he resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, they moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 1979, which they had "fallen in love with" after a visit the year before on their way to the [[36th World Science Fiction Convention|worldcon in Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/george-r-r-martin-interview|title=George R.R.

Martin is a member of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA); he served as the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1976, for Kansas City's [[MidAmeriCon]], the [[34th World Science Fiction Convention]] ([[Worldcon]]), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor [[Gardner Dozois]] conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the novella ''The Storms of Windhaven'', co-written with [[Lisa Tuttle]].<ref name="Locusmag">{{cite news|url= http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusNomList.html|work= The Locus|title= Index to SF Awards|access-date= August 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090505221416/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusNomList.html|archive-date= May 5, 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref> Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined [[future history]], known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm".

In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered ''[[Sandkings (novelette)|Sandkings]]'' (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella ''[[Nightflyers]]'' (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, ''[[Nightflyers (film)|Nightflyers]]'', with a screenplay co-written by Martin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrm.livejournal.com/555986.html|title=The NIGHTFLYER Flies Again|last=grrm|date=November 27, 2017|website=livejournal.com}}</ref> Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.<ref name="NPR2012">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/15/161142894/thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-plays-not-my-job?ps=view&ec=mostpopular | title='Thrones' Author George R.R.

In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled ''[[Fevre Dream]]'' set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in ''Fevre Dream'' vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised ''Fevre Dream'' for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: "This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time".<ref name="D'Amassa pages 388-390">D'Amassa, Don "Martin, George" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 1997 page 390.</ref> Martin followed up ''Fevre Dream'' with another [[horror novel]], ''[[The Armageddon Rag]]'' (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'' "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled, and made him consider going into [[real estate]] instead.<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/failure-nearly-made-apos-game-143043933.html This failure nearly made 'Game of Thrones' creator George R.R. Martin stop writing and go into real estate]</ref>

In 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like [[Solomon Kane]], [[Elric]], [[Nicholas van Rijn]] and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel ''Black and White and Red All Over'', which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'', all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in ''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt ''The Armageddon Rag'' into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.<ref name="berwick20120601">{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 1, 2012 | access-date=June 1, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp2dODRtZOUC&q=fantasy+Moorcock%27s+Elric+Howard%27s+Solomon+Kane%2C+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry&pg=PT8|title=Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective|first=George R.

After the [[CBS]] series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series [[Max Headroom (TV series)|''Max Headroom'']]. He worked on scripts and created the show's "Ped Xing" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.

In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in ''[[Portraits of His Children]]''. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author ''[[Wild Cards]]'' book series, which takes place in a [[shared universe]] in which a small slice of post–[[World War II]] humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from [[Tor Books]].

====HBO adaptation====
{{Further|Game of Thrones}}
[[HBO]] Productions purchased the television rights for the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series in 2007 and began airing the fantasy series on their US premium cable channel on April 17, 2011. Titled ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', it ran weekly for ten episodes, each approximately an hour long.<ref>[http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/03/hbo-greenlights-game-of-thrones.html HBO greenlights ''Game of Thrones'' to series (pic)], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', November 30, 2010</ref> Although busy completing ''A Dance With Dragons'' and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired.

The first season was nominated for 13 [[Emmy Awards]], ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for [[Peter Dinklage]] as Best Supporting Actor.

The first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the [[World Science Fiction Society]] each year at the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon]]; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form'', at [[Chicon 7]], the [[70th World Science Fiction Convention]]. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to ''Game of Thrones'' show-runners [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].

The second season, based on the second ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novel ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', began airing on HBO in the US on April 1, 2012. The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second-season episode "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]", written by Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form'' category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the [[71st World Science Fiction Convention]]. In addition to Martin, show-runners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes.

Seasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen [[Emmy Awards]], including Outstanding Drama Series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-hbo-marathon-year-end-1201946918/ |title='Game of Thrones': Year-End Marathon to Air on HBO |last=Yee |first=Lawrence |date=December 21, 2016 |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |access-date=December 21, 2016 |quote=It has been nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Drama every season it's aired, winning the award the last two years.

It has won five straight Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Television Series, and is up for a sixth in January.}}</ref>

By the end of 2016, all seasons up to [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|season 6]] (which premiered on April 24, 2016) had been aired on HBO and all seasons had been released on DVD and/or Blu-ray<ref>{{cite web |title=Game of Thrones: The Complete Sixth Season [Blu-ray]|website=Amazon |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2JPULU/ |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> for home viewing (see [[List of Game of Thrones episodes|List of ''Game of Thrones'' episodes]]). The company confirmed on July 18, 2016, that [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|season 7]] would consist of seven episodes instead of the usual ten, and would premiere later than usual, in mid-2017, because of the later filming schedule. This was necessary in order to be shooting during the winter season in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/18/game-thrones-season-7|title=Game of Thrones: HBO announces summer return, 7 episodes|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=July 18, 2016|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> Season 7 was expected to air in mid 2017.

This story has a strong sense of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to [[idealism]]s in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of [[tragic hero]]es or [[antihero]]es in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: "Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic."<ref name="TMWagner">{{cite web |url= http://www.sfreviews.net/stormofswords.html |title=A Storm of Swords / George R.

}}</ref> However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of "realness" and "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) [[Peripeteia|consequential plot twists]] that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:<blockquote>There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.<ref name="TMWagner" /></blockquote>Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. ''Publishers Weekly'' writes of his ongoing epic fantasy ''A Song of Ice and Fire'': "The complexity of characters such as [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] or [[Robert Jordan|Jordan]], makes us care about their fates."<ref>[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-553-10663-3 Review of ''A Storm of Swords''] by Publishers Weekly</ref> Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.qbd.com.au/author/george-r-r-martin/ |title=George R R Martin |work=QBD The Bookshop |year=2014 |access-date=July 8, 2014}}</ref>

In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic "[[good and evil|good versus evil]]" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent "heroic knights and chivalry" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as "Disneyland Middle Ages",<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/04/18/grrm-interview-part-2-fantasy-and-history/ | magazine=Time | date=April 18, 2011 | title=GRRM Interview Part 2: Fantasy and History}}</ref> which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements.

==Relationship with fans==

Martin's official fan club is the "Brotherhood Without Banners", which has a regular posting board at the Forum of the website westeros.org, which is focused on his ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' fantasy series. At the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention]] every year, the Brotherhood Without Banners hosts a large, on-going hospitality suite that is open to all members of the Worldcon.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014|title=George R.R.

===Conventions===
Martin is known for his regular attendance at [[science fiction convention]]s and comics conventions, and his accessibility to fans. In the early 1980s, critic and writer [[Thomas Disch]] identified Martin as a member of the "Labor Day Group", writers who regularly congregated at the annual [[Worldcon]], usually held on or around the [[Labor Day]] weekend. Since the early 1970s, he has also attended regional science fiction conventions; further, since 1986, Martin has participated annually in [[Albuquerque]]'s smaller regional convention [[Bubonicon]], near his [[New Mexico]] home.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472068968-17.pdf |title=The Labor Day Group |first=Thomas M. |last=Disch |work=The University of Michigan Press |year=2005 |access-date=July 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/ |title=Tour Dates/Appearances |work=georgerrmartin.com |year=2014 |access-date=July 8, 2014}}</ref> He was the Guest of Honor at the [[61st World Science Fiction Convention]] in Toronto, held in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0410/theheartofasmall.shtml/ |title=Worldcon GoH Speech |work=asimovs.com |year=2003 |access-date=September 9, 2014 |url-status = bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323092315/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0410/theheartofasmall.shtml/ |archive-date=March 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/torcon3.html/ |title=Ansible Report |work=ansible.co.uk |year=2003 |access-date=September 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922143254/http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/torcon3.html |archive-date=September 22, 2011 }}</ref>

In December 2016, Martin was a key speaker at the Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016 in Mexico where the author provided hints about the next two books in the series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/12/06/george-rr-martin-teases-winds-of-winter/ |title=George RR Martin on Winds of Winter: Things are getting worse |last=Gettell |first=Oliver |date=December 6, 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |access-date=December 21, 2016 |quote=Watch Martin's full Q&A above.}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Martin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005), and the fifth volume, ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Miller | first = Laura | title = Onward and Upward with the Arts: Just Write It!: A fantasy author and his impatient fans. |magazine=The New Yorker | date = April 11, 2011 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/11/110411fa_fact_miller | access-date = February 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last = Kay | first = Guy Gavriel | title = Restless readers go bonkers | work = Globe and Mail | location = Canada | date = April 10, 2009 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/article8003.ece | access-date = May 13, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100509021936/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/article8003.ece | archive-date = May 9, 2010 | df = mdy-all}}</ref> In 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Flood | first = Alison | title = Excitement as George RR Martin announces he's 1,200 pages into new book |work = The Guardian | date = February 16, 2010 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/16/george-rr-martin-new-book | access-date = May 13, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Writer [[Neil Gaiman]] famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, "George R.

In the early 1970s, Martin was in a relationship with fellow science fiction/fantasy author [[Lisa Tuttle]], with whom he co-wrote ''[[Windhaven]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Love With Lisa|url=http://georgerrmartin.com/life/chicago.html|work=Life & Times|publisher=George R.R.

While attending an East Coast science fiction convention he met his first wife, Gale Burnick; they were married in 1975. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979, without issue, just before they were meant to move to Santa Fe together. Instead he settled there alone from December that same year until September 1981, when what would be his longtime partner Parris McBride moved in with him.<ref>D'Amassa, Don "Martin, George" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 1997 page 388.</ref><ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/08/15/back-in-westeros/ Back in Westeros | Not a Blog - George RR Martin]</ref> On February 15, 2011, Martin married Parris during a small ceremony at their [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] home.

==Philanthropy==
In 2014, Martin launched a campaign on [[Prizeo]] to raise funds for [[Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary]] and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. As part of the campaign, Martin offered one donor the chance to accompany him on a trip to the wolf sanctuary, including a helicopter ride and dinner. Martin also offered those donating $20,000 or more the opportunity to have a character named after them and "killed off" in an upcoming ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novel. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/29/george-r-r-martins-game-of-thrones-charity-fundraiser-draws-winner/|title=George R.R.
