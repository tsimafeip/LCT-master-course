'''Edward Christopher Sheeran''' {{post-nominals|size=100%|country=GBR|MBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɪər|ən}}; born 17 February 1991) is an English singer-songwriter. Born in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]] and raised in [[Framlingham]], Suffolk, he began writing songs around the age of eleven. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended play, ''[[No. 5 Collaborations Project]]''. He signed with [[Asylum Records]] the same year.

Sheeran's debut album, ''[[+ (album)|+]]'' (pronounced "plus"), was released in September 2011 and topped the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It contained his first hit single "[[The A Team (Ed Sheeran song)|The A Team]]". In 2012, Sheeran won the [[Brit Awards]] for [[Brit Award for British Male Solo Artist|Best British Male Solo Artist]] and [[Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act|British Breakthrough Act]]. Sheeran's second studio album, ''[[x (Ed Sheeran album)|×]]'' (pronounced "multiply"), topped charts around the world upon its release in June 2014. It was named the second-best-selling album worldwide of 2015. In the same year, ''×'' won [[2015 Brit Awards#Nominees and winners|Album of the Year]] at the [[2015 Brit Awards]], and he received the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Songwriter of the Year from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]]. A single from ''×'', "[[Thinking Out Loud]]", earned him the 2016 [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]].

Sheeran's third album, ''[[÷ (album)|÷]]'' (pronounced "divide"), was released in March 2017, and was the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|best-selling album worldwide of 2017]].

Sheeran began recording music in 2004 and independently released his first collection of work, tiled ''Spinning Man''.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|"In 2004, I made my very first album, ''Spinning Man'', named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: '''I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.''' There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn't that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it – my first love songs."<ref>''Ed Sheeran: A Visual Journey'', pg 38</ref>}} He has been friends with fellow English singer, [[Passenger (singer)|Passenger]], since he was 15, with the two playing the same gig in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2012/12/07/passenger_aka_mike_rosenberg_grateful_for_ed_sheerans_support.html|title=Passenger, a.k.a.

==Politics==
Sheeran publicly opposed [[Brexit]] (the [[United Kingdom]] leaving the [[European Union]]), and supported "remain". Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|June 2016 referendum result]] where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], [[Pink Floyd]] drummer [[Nick Mason]] and [[Damon Albarn]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Gorillaz]]) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], drafted by [[Bob Geldof]] in October 2018, calling for "[[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|a 2nd vote]]". Stating that Brexit will "impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation", the letter adds: "We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is."<ref>{{cite news |title=UK music stars rail against Brexit in open letter to Theresa May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/06/uk-musician-warn-botched-brexit |access-date=30 May 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and described himself as a "fan" of its then-leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], while adding that "I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do."<ref>{{cite news |title=Ed Sheeran says he is a fan of Jeremy Corbyn: 'He cares about other people' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ed-sheeran-jeremy-corbyn-politics-music-labour-party-general-election-grammy-awards-nominations-a8103091.html |access-date=15 November 2020 |work=The Independent}}</ref>

In 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the [[United States Congress]] to pass the proposed [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], which would expand the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] in order to outlaw discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is "essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Meyers |first1=Dave |title=Ariana Grande, Pink, Halsey, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga & more urge Congress to pass the Equality Act |url=https://www.wrmf.com/ariana-grande-pink-halsey-taylor-swift-ed-sheeran-lady-gaga-more-urge-congress-to-pass-the-equality-act/ |access-date=22 June 2021 |work=[[WRMF|WRMF FM]] |date=22 June 2021}}</ref>

In 2022, during the full-scale [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Sheeran expressed support for [[Ukraine]] and participated in the [[Concert for Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite news |date=21 March 2022 |title=Ed Sheeran and Camila Cabello join Ukraine concert line-up |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60822865 |access-date=28 March 2022}}</ref>
