Obama was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]]  in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district]] in the [[Illinois Senate]] from 1997 until 2004, when he [[2004 United States Senate election in Illinois|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, a year after beginning [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|his campaign]], and after [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|a close primary campaign]] against [[Hillary Clinton]], he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama was elected over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|general election]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] alongside his running mate [[Joe Biden]], on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.

Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two [[Presidency of Barack Obama|years in office]]. The main reforms include: the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA or "Obamacare"), although without a [[public health insurance option]]; the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]; and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010|Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act]] served as economic stimuli amidst the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]]. After a [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|lengthy debate over the national debt limit]], he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–[[Russia]] [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007–2011)|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. In 2011, Obama ordered the drone-strike killing of [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], a US citizen and suspected [[al-Qaeda]] operative, leading to controversy. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]] for the implementation of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN Security Council Resolution 1973]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also ordered the [[Killing of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|military operation]] that resulted in the death of [[Osama bin Laden]].

After winning [[2012 United States presidential election|re-election]] by defeating Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] on January 20, 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in ''Obergefell''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[global warming]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|military interventions in Iraq]] and [[American-led intervention in the Syrian civil war|Syria]] in response to gains made by [[Islamic State|ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, oversaw and ultimately apologized for the deadly [[Kunduz hospital airstrike]], drew down [[Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2011–2016)|U.S. troops in Afghanistan]] in 2016, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 U.S. elections]], brokered the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] nuclear deal with Iran, and [[Cuban thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]]. Obama nominated [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates|three justices to the Supreme Court]]: [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as justices, while [[Merrick Garland]] was [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|denied hearings or a vote]] from the Republican-majority [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in [[Washington, D.C.]]

During Obama's [[Presidency of Barack Obama|terms as president]], the United States' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. Scholars and historians rank him among [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Notable scholar surveys|the upper to mid tier]] of American presidents. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 midterm elections]], appearing at the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]] and campaigning for Biden during the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. Outside of politics, Obama has published three [[Bibliography of Barack Obama|bestselling books]]: ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' (1995)'', [[The Audacity of Hope]]'' (2006) and ''[[A Promised Land]]'' (2020).

====Religious views====

Obama is a [[Protestant]] Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.<ref name="Christian" /> He wrote in ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'' that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person{{nbsp}}... I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for [[secular humanism]]." He described his father as a "confirmed [[Atheism|atheist]]" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."<ref name="social change" />

Obama called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.<ref name="health reform" /> He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900{{nbs}}billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the [[public health insurance option|public option]], to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912093912/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.html |archive-date=2009-09-12 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title = Obama, Armed With Details, Says Health Plan Is Necessary |last1 = Stolberg |first1 = Sheryl Gay |last2 = Zeleny |first2 = Jeff |date = September 9, 2009 |newspaper = The New York Times |access-date = July 5, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first = Mike |last = Allen |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/26907.html |title = Barack Obama will hedge on public option |work = [[Politico]] |access-date = July 5, 2015 |date = September 9, 2009 }}</ref>

On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The "Complex Modernization" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/1/headlines|title=Headlines for October 01, 2009|website=Democracy Now!}}</ref> In November 2013, the Obama administration opened [[Negotiations leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|negotiations]] with Iran to prevent it from acquiring [[nuclear weapon]]s, which included an [[Joint Plan of Action|interim agreement]]. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons.
