=== Tax avoidance strategies ===
{{Further|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes|Google tax}}
Google uses various [[tax avoidance]] strategies. On the [[list of the largest information technology companies]], it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]] and then to [[Bermuda]]. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=October 22, 2010 |title=Google slips $3.1bn through 'Double Irish' tax loophole. |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706132414/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/ |archive-date=July 6, 2017 |access-date=August 10, 2017 |website=The Register}}</ref> This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's [[transfer pricing]] practices.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leach |first=Anna |date=October 31, 2012 |title=French gov 'plans to hand Google €1bn tax bill'&nbsp;– report |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104002014/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |archive-date=January 4, 2013 |access-date=January 2, 2013 |publisher=Theregister.co.uk}}</ref>

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a [[nuclear power plant]].
