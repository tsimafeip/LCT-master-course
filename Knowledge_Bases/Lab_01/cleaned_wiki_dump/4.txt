Sheeran began recording music in 2004 and independently released his first collection of work, tiled Spinning Man.efn group upper alpha "In 2004, I made my very first album, Spinning Man, named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt CDs myself and made covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went  'I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.' There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break up. Looking back, it really wasn't that bad, but at time it was soul shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off back of it – my first love songs." >Ed Sheeran  A Visual Journey, pg 38 > He has been friends with fellow English singer, Passenger (singer) Passenger, since he was 15, with two playing same gig in Cambridge. > news url a.k.a.
