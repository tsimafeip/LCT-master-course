In this lab, we are working on **relation extraction**. Our end goal is to be able to
extract the following properties for given *entity* and their *Wikipedia abstract*: 
  - Date of Birth
  - Nationality
  - Alma Mater
  - Awards
  - Places of Work

In this exercise, we focus on using **pattern-based extraction**.

**Solution**:
I mostly rely on spacy named entities recognition with some highly characteristic words matching.
