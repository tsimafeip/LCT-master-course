Volkswagen was established in 1937 by the [[German Labour Front]] (''Deutsche Arbeitsfront'') in [[Berlin]].<ref name="chronicle">{{Cite book|title=Volkswagen Chronicle |editor1=Manfred Grieger |editor2=Ulrike Gutzmann |editor3=Dirk Schlinkert |publisher=Volkswagen AG |year=2008 |series=Historical Notes |volume=7 |isbn=978-3-935112-11-6 |url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2008/05/chronicle.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/HN7e_www2.pdf |access-date=21 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216072143/http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2008/05/chronicle.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/HN7e_www2.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2010 }}</ref> In the early 1930s, cars were a luxury – most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle and only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent "people's car" projects&nbsp;– the [[Mercedes-Benz 130|Mercedes 170H]], [[BMW 3/15]], [[Adler 2.5-litre|Adler AutoBahn]], [[Steyr 50|Steyr 55]], and [[Hanomag]] 1.3L, among others.

The growing trend was not nascent; [[Béla Barényi]], a pioneering automotive engineer, is credited as already having conceived the basic design during the mid-1920s. [[Josef Ganz]] developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the "German Volkswagen"). In Germany, the company [[Hanomag]] mass-produced the [[Hanomag 2/10 PS|2/10 PS]] "Kommissbrot", a small, cheap rear-engined car, from 1925 to 1928.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Elan|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=154651|title=Was Hitler's Beetle designed by a Jew?|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=13 September 2009|access-date=18 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523125036/http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=154651|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Also, in Czechoslovakia, the [[Hans Ledwinka]]'s penned [[Tatra T77]], a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision. [[Ferdinand Porsche]], a well-known designer for high-end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family.  He built a car named the "Volksauto" from the ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear [[Internal combustion engine#Reciprocating engines|engine]], [[torsion bar suspension]], and a "beetle" shape, the front bonnet rounded for better [[aerodynamic]]s (necessary as it had a small engine).<ref name=SmallWonder>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Walter|title=Small Wonder|year=1967|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|page=333}}</ref>

In 1934, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, [[Adolf Hitler]] became involved, ordering the production of a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. He wanted a car every German family would be able to afford.<ref name=SmallWonder /> The "People's Car" would be available through a savings plan at [[Reichsmark|RM]]990  (US$396 in 1938)—about the price of a small motorcycle (the average income being around RM32 a week).<ref name="RiseFall">William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990)</ref><ref name="LastBeet">{{cite web|url=http://www.lasteditionbeetle.com/history.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306113930/http://www.lasteditionbeetle.com/history.php|title=Last Edition Beetle: History|archive-date=6 March 2008|website=Lasteditionbeetle.com|access-date=22 September 2015}}</ref>

It soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only RM990.  Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all-new, state-owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design suggestions, including an air-cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that German families could buy the car through a savings scheme (''"{{lang|de|Fünf Mark die Woche musst du sparen, willst du im eigenen Wagen fahren}}"&nbsp;– "Five Marks a week you must set aside, if in your own car you wish to ride''"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into.<ref>König, Wolfgang.

Prototypes of the car called the "KdF-Wagen" (German: ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]''{{snd}} "Strength through Joy") appeared from 1938 onwards (the first cars had been produced in [[Stuttgart]]). The car already had its distinctive round shape and [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]], [[Flat-4|flat-four]], [[Rear-engine design|rear-mounted engine]]. The VW car was just one of many [[Strength Through Joy|KdF]] programs, which included things such as tours and outings.

[[Erwin Komenda]], the longstanding [[Auto Union]] chief designer, part of Ferdinand Porsche's hand-picked team,<ref name=SmallWonder /> developed the car body of the prototype, which was recognisably the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] known today. It was one of the first cars designed with the aid of a [[wind tunnel]]—a method used for German aircraft design since the early 1920s. The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.

The construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of "Stadt des KdF-Wagens" (renamed [[Wolfsburg]] after the war), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.<ref name="Odin, L.C. 2015"/> This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939. None were actually delivered to any holder of the completed saving stamp books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1944 (his 55th birthday).<ref name="Odin, L.C. 2015"/>

=== 1939–1944: Wartime production and concentration camp labour ===

War changed production to military vehicles—the Type 82 ''[[Volkswagen Kübelwagen|Kübelwagen]]'' ("Bucket car") utility vehicle (VW's most common wartime model), and the [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] ''[[Volkswagen Schwimmwagen|Schwimmwagen]]''—manufactured for German forces. One of the first foreigners to drive a Volkswagen was the American war correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]], who had the use of a captured Volkswagen for a few days after the Allied victory in Tunisia in May 1943.<ref>Pyle, Ernie, ''Here Is Your War'', Cleveland, World Publishing Company, Forum Books edition, 1945, pp. 275, 293.</ref> <!-- There is an unreasonably large gap in the history here from April 1938 until April 1945. With the amount of detail given both before April 1938 and after April 1945, this omission should at least be noted, if not fully fleshed out. --> As was common with much of the production in [[Nazi Germany]] during the war, [[slave]] labour was utilised in the Volkswagen plant, e.g. from [[Arbeitsdorf]] concentration camp. The company would admit in 1998 that it used 15,000 slaves during the war effort. German historians estimated that 80% of Volkswagen's wartime workforce was slave labour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Management Systems and Performance Frameworks for Sustainability: A Road Map for Sustainably Managed Enterprises |author1=Lowellyne James |edition=illustrated |publisher=Routledge |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-317-23450-0 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUhaDwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUhaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT17 Extract of page 17]</ref> Many of the slaves were reported to have been supplied from the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] upon request from plant managers.

===1945–1948: British Army intervention===
[[File:VW Wolfsburg.JPG|thumb|Volkswagen industrial plant in Wolfsburg, pictured in 2006]]
In April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the [[United States Armed Forces|United States armed forces]] and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose [[British Occupation zone in Germany|occupation zone]] the town and factory fell. The factory was placed under the control of [[British Army]] officer Major [[Ivan Hirst]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|REME]], a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a "political animal" rather than a commercial enterprise{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} – technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] – the equipment could have been salvaged as [[war reparations]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

One of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as [[carburetor|carburettors]]) were unavailable. Hirst and his German assistant [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilise the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the [[East Germany|Soviet zone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=Lindsay|title=Mr|journal=Thoroughbred & Classic Cars|date=October 1986}}</ref> The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to [[Australia Post]]. Some British [[Soldier|Service personnel]] were allowed to take their [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetles]] back to the United Kingdom when they were [[Demobilization|demobilised]].<ref name=uk-import-first>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillsideimports.com/vw-history/the-first-demonstrator-of-the-volkswagen-beetle |title=Volkswagen Model 11 Beetle |website=hillsideimports.com |date=20 February 2014 |access-date=4 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404000212/http://www.hillsideimports.com/vw-history/the-first-demonstrator-of-the-volkswagen-beetle |archive-date=4 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1986, Hirst said that factory workers were, after many years of Nazi conditioning, initially reluctant to follow his orders; to counter this, he had his military uniform brought back from Britain and wore it in the factory, after which he reported having no problems even though he was no longer a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The post-war [[industrial plans for Germany]] set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK |title=Harry S.

The car and its town changed their Second World War-era names to "Volkswagen" and "[[Wolfsburg]]" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries who all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, [[William Edward Rootes, 1st Baron Rootes|Sir William Rootes]], head of the British [[Rootes Group]], told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car "...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy ... If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man." {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The official report said: "To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise."<ref>Anders Ditlev Clausager (18 March 2000).

Ford representatives were equally critical. In March 1948, the British offered the Volkswagen company to Ford, free of charge. [[Henry Ford II]], the son of [[Edsel Ford]], traveled to [[West Germany]] for discussions. Heinz Nordhoff was also present, as well as Ernest Breech, chairman of the board for Ford. Henry Ford II looked to Breech for his opinion, and Breech said, "Mr. Ford, I don't think what we're being offered here is worth a damn!"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Walter Henry |title=Small Wonder: The Amazing Story of the Volkswagen |date=1970 |publisher=Little, Brown |page=18 |access-date=10 November 2020|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrMeAQAAMAAJ&q=%22worth+a+damn%22}}</ref> Ford passed on the offer, leaving Volkswagen to rebuild itself under Nordhoff's leadership.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

From 1948, Volkswagen became an important element, symbolically and economically, of [[Wirtschaftswunder|West German regeneration]].{{according to whom|date=July 2017}} [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (1899–1968), a former senior manager at [[Opel]] who had overseen civilian and military vehicle production in the 1930s and 1940s, was recruited to run the factory in 1948. In 1949, Major Hirst left the company—now re-formed as a trust controlled by the West German government and government of the State of [[Lower Saxony]]. The "Beetle" sedan or "peoples' car" Volkswagen is the Type 1. Apart from the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[commercial vehicle]] (van, pick-up, and camper), and the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|VW Karmann Ghia]] sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.

Volkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the US market, the VW was briefly sold as a ''Victory Wagon''. [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.

The UK's first official Volkswagen importer, Colborne Garages of [[Ripley, Surrey]], started business with importing parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.<ref name=uk-import-first/>

Canadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The order consisted of 12 vehicles, (3) model 11C, a black, green, and sand colour (3) 11GS, a chestnut brown and two azure blue, (2) 24A-M51 in red, (1) 21A in blue, (1) 23A in blue, (1) 22A beige colour, and one ambulance.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Volkswagens were seen in Canada for the first time at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 and were accepted enthusiastically. (At least one Type 2 bus from this order still exists, and is currently in France undergoing restoration).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The first shipment for Volkswagen Canada reached Toronto in early December 1952. (At least one Type 1 from this first shipment still exists, and was driven on a nationwide tour for Volkswagen Canada's 60th year of business festivities in 2012).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

By 1955, sales warranted the building of the Volkswagen plant on a {{convert|32|acre|ha|adj=on}} site on [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough's]] [[Golden Mile, Toronto|Golden Mile]]. To this, a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building with administration, showrooms, service, repairs and parts was built in 1957, with storage for $4,000,000 of parts.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On 22 August 1960, ''Volkswagenwerk GmbH'' was renamed to ''Volkswagenwerk AG''. Sales soared throughout the 1960s, peaking at the end of the decade thanks in part to the famous advertising campaigns by New York advertising agency [[DDB Worldwide|Doyle, Dane Bernbach]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Led by art director [[Helmut Krone]], and copywriters [[Julian Koenig]] and Bob Levinson, Volkswagen advertisements became{{when|date=July 2017}} as popular as the car, using crisp layouts and witty copy to lure the younger, sophisticated consumers with whom the car became associated.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Even though it was almost universally known as the Beetle (or the Bug), it was never officially labelled as such by the manufacturer, instead referred to as the Type 1.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patton|first=Phil|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49959289|title=Bug : the strange mutations of the world's most famous automobile|date=2002|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-7432-0242-2|location=New York|pages=137|oclc=49959289}}</ref>

Although the car was becoming outdated, during the 1960s and early 1970s, American exports, innovative advertising, and a growing reputation for reliability helped production figures surpass the levels of the previous record-holder, the [[Ford Model T]]. On 17 February 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history. By 1973, total production was over 16 million.

To commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the "Baja Champion SE"<ref>All Volkswagen Cars List [https://qesot.com/cars/en/brand/80/ All Volkswagen Cars Models] Qesot.com</ref> in the United States and the "Marathon" Superbeetle in the rest of the world. It featured unique "Marathon Blau" metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke {{convert|15|in|cm|0|adj=on}} magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] fog lights mounted on the front bumper.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===1961–1973: Beetle to Golf===
[[File:Volkswagen Type 3.jpg|thumb|left|A 1963 [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW Type 3 Notchback]] ]]

The 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36&nbsp;hp 1200cc four cylinder air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made of aluminium alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300cc engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500cc engine, and 1600cc in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favour in the United States market with the advent of unleaded petrol and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the US West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularised on the US West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.

VW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.

In 1969 the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque]]/unibody construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.

In 1964, Volkswagen acquired [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU). The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]]. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.

Volkswagen added a "Super Beetle"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dean |first=Wayne |date=28 October 2006 |url=http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |title=History of the Super Beetle |publisher=superbeetles.com |access-date=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213643/http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]]. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.

In 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or "Trekker" in Europe, "Thing" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979. The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.

By late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished [[:File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|typ 266]], a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars.

[[File:Vw passat b1 v sst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Volkswagen Passat]] (1973–1977 model)]]

Volkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973.<ref>William Beaver (Nov–Dec 1992). [https://archive.today/20120709024025/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1038/is_n6_v35/ai_13246858 Volkswagen's American assembly plant: Fahrvergnugen was not enough – international marketing] Find Articles; Business Horizons.</ref> The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than the Beetle and the [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]]-based K70 also failed to sell. Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/[[Auto Union]] proved beneficial. Its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[water cooling|water-cooled]] engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], and Polo.

First in the series was the [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a [[fastback]] version of the [[Audi 80]], using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.

In spring 1974, the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] followed. The coupe was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Based on the platform of the not yet released [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], it was built at [[Karmann]] due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.

The pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975–1985) and 5th generation (2006–2009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]]&nbsp;– the Golf had a [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.

In 1975, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] followed. It was a re-badged [[Audi 50]], which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the [[Volkswagen Derby]], which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a [[Three-box styling|three-box design]] of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the polo classic/polo saloon until 1991.

Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.

===1974–1990: Product line expansion===
[[File:VW Polo I front 20090810.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo Mk1|Volkswagen Polo]] (1975–1979 model)]]

While Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European car makers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen line-up since its introduction, and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the [[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref> The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.

Volkswagen entered the supermini market in 1975 with the [[Volkswagen Polo]], a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]. It was a strong seller in West Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the [[Audi 50]], which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a market sector already being dominated by the [[Fiat 127]] and [[Renault 5]], and which before long would also include the [[Austin Metro]] and [[Ford Fiesta]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1981, the second-generation Polo launched as a hatchback (resembling a small estate car). In 1983 the range was expanded, with the introduction of a Coupe (similar to a conventional hatchback), and the Classic (a 2-door saloon).<ref>{{cite web |title=Series 2 Polo: 1981-1994 |url=http://www.polodriver.com/heritage/series-2-polo-1981-1994/ |website=polodriver.com/ |publisher=Polo Driver}}</ref> The Polo's practicality, despite the lack of a five-door version, helped ensure even stronger sales than its predecessor. It continued to sell well after a makeover in 1990, finally being replaced by an all-new version in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=Series 3 Polo: 1994-2001 |url=http://www.polodriver.com/heritage/series-3-polo-1994-2001/ |website=www.polodriver.com |publisher=Polo Driver}}</ref> Also arriving in 1981 were the second generation of the larger Passat and a second generation of the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] coupe.

In 1983 the MK2 Golf was launched. At the beginning of 1988, the third generation Passat was the next major car launch and Volkswagen did not produce a hatchback version of this Passat, despite the rising popularity of the hatchback body style throughout Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Just after launching the B3 Passat, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]], analogous to the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]], although the Scirocco remained in production until 1992; a third generation of Scirocco was in production 2008–17.<ref>Rob Stumpf, "The Volkswagen Scirocco is Dead (Again)", ''The Drive'' (12 October 2017): online at https://www.thedrive.com/sheetmetal/15084/the-volkswagen-scirocco-is-dead-again</ref>

===1991–1999===
[[File:Volkswagen Golf IV 3-door.jpg|thumb|right|Volkswagen Golf, in North American form]]

In 1991, Volkswagen launched the third-generation Golf, which was [[European Car of the Year]] for 1992. The [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|Golf Mk3]] and [[Volkswagen Vento (A3)|Jetta Mk3]] arrived in North America in 1993. The sedan version of the Golf was badged Vento in Europe but remained Jetta in the United States. The [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] and the later [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] were both Golf-based [[coupé]]s.

In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[J Mays]]-designed [[Volkswagen New Beetle#Concept 1|Concept One]], a "retro"-themed [[concept car]] with a resemblance to the original Beetle, based on the platform of the Polo. Due to a positive response to the concept, a production version was developed as the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]], based on the Golf's larger platform.<ref name="ltvvwc-2003">{{cite web|title=The VW Experimental Vehicles – the 1980s to present pt 2|url=http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/WS_feb_2003/WnW-prototypes04.htm|work=Wheelspin|publisher=London & Thames Valley VW Club|access-date=12 July 2010|date=February 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614094520/http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/WS_feb_2003/WnW-prototypes04.htm|archive-date=14 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1995 the [[Volkswagen Sharan|Sharan]] was launched in Europe, the result of a joint venture with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], which also resulted in the [[Ford Galaxy]] and [[SEAT Alhambra]].<ref>{{cite web|title=VW Sharan|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/VW-Sharan-2011-CAR-review/|website=Car Magazine|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104171105/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/VW-Sharan-2011-CAR-review/|archive-date=4 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The company's evolution of its model range was continued with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Golf Mk4]], introduced at the end of 1997 (North America in 1999), its chassis spawned a host of other cars within the Volkswagen Group; the [[Volkswagen Bora]] (the sedan known as the Jetta in the United States), SEAT Toledo, SEAT León, [[Audi A3]], [[Audi TT]], and [[Škoda Octavia]]. Other main models during the decade include the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] for the segment above the Golf.

In 1998 the company launched the new [[Volkswagen Lupo|Lupo]] city car. In 1999 they announced the first "3-litre" car, a lightweight version of the Lupo that could travel 100&nbsp;km with only 3-liters of diesel—making it the world's most fuel efficient car at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=VW launches its economic miracle|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/vw-launches-its-economic-miracle/285981.article|website=The Engineer|access-date=4 January 2015|date=5 January 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104162606/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/vw-launches-its-economic-miracle/285981.article|archive-date=4 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===2000–2016: Further expansion===
[[File:2011 Volkswagen Jetta (1KM MY10) 118TSI sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|left|The fifth generation [[Volkswagen Jetta (A5)|Volkswagen Jetta]]]]

Volkswagen began introducing an array of new models after [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]] became [[Volkswagen Group]] CEO (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002. The sixth-generation [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|VW Golf]] was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the [[Opel Insignia|Opel/Vauxhall Insignia]] in the 2009 [[European Car of the Year]], and has spawned several cousins: [[Volkswagen Jetta (A6)|VW Jetta]], [[VW Scirocco]], [[SEAT León]], [[SEAT Toledo]], [[Škoda Octavia]] and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-[[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]], the [[SEAT Altea]]. The GTI, a "[[hot hatch]]" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]] Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the US and Canada in 2006.

The sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and Volkswagen announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] by 2008. Other models in [[Wolfgang Bernhard]]'s (Volkswagen brand CEO) "product offensive" include the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]] mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a [[Volkswagen Passat Coupé|Passat Coupé]]. In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] at the beginning of 2007.

[[File:VW Scirocco III 1.4 TSI DSG Team Deep Black.JPG|thumb|right|The third generation [[Volkswagen Scirocco]]]]

Volkswagen maintained North American sales of 224,195 in 2005. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in [[Curitiba]], where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favourable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's "[[Car and Driver Ten Best|10 Best]]" for 2007, [[Automobile Magazine|''Automobile'' Magazine's]] 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.

Volkswagen partnered with [[Daimler AG]] and other companies to market the [[BlueTec]] [[clean diesel]] technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available for sale in the United States are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&year1=2012&year2=2013&vfuel=Diesel&mclass=Small+Cars,%20Family+Sedans,%20Large+Sedans,%20Upscale+Sedans,%20Luxury+Sedans,%20Hatchbacks,%20Coupes,%20Convertibles,%20Sports/Sporty+Cars,%20Station+Wagons&srchtyp=newDslCars |title=Fuel Economy of New Diesel Cars |year=2012 |website=Fueleconomy.gov |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=5 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117191226/http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&year1=2012&year2=2013&vfuel=Diesel&mclass=Small+Cars%2C%20Family+Sedans%2C%20Large+Sedans%2C%20Upscale+Sedans%2C%20Luxury+Sedans%2C%20Hatchbacks%2C%20Coupes%2C%20Convertibles%2C%20Sports%2FSporty+Cars%2C%20Station+Wagons&srchtyp=newDslCars |archive-date=17 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI ([[Turbocharged Direct Injection]]) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} For the 2007 model year, however, strict US government emissions regulations had forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their US engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to US standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and later the [[Audi Q7]]. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the "Concept A" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 [[Geneva Auto Show]], and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]].

Since the discontinuation of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.

In September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 "City Golf (Golf City in 2009)" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]]. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.

===Relationship with Porsche and the Volkswagen Law===
Volkswagen has always had a close relationship with [[Porsche]], the [[Stuttgart|Zuffenhausen]]-based sports car manufacturer founded in 1931 by [[Ferdinand Porsche]], the original Volkswagen designer and Volkswagen company co-founder, hired by Adolf Hitler for the project. The first Porsche car, the [[Porsche 64]] of 1938, used many components from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. The 1948 [[Porsche 356]] continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, [[gearbox]] and suspension.

The two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6]]. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the [[Porsche 912]]-E (the USA only) and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many [[Audi]] components and was built at Audi's [[Neckarsulm]] facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most [[Porsche 944]] models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.

The [[Porsche Cayenne]], introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in [[Bratislava]] that the other SUVs are built.

In September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of €3&nbsp;billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |title=Porsche wants 20% Volkswagen deal &#124; 26 September 2005 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2005 |access-date=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006040107/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |archive-date=6 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Speculated suitors included [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]]. In July 2006, Porsche increased their ownership again to 25.1%.

On 4 March 2005, the European Commission brought an action against the Federal Republic of Germany before the European Court of Justice, claiming that the [[Volkswagen Law]], which prevents any shareholder in Volkswagen from executing more than 20% of the total voting rights in the firm, was illegally restricting the flow of capital in Europe.<ref name="Official Text of the action">{{cite web|author=Commission of the European Communities|title=Action brought on 4 March 2005 by the Commission of the European Communities against the Federal Republic of Germany|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=Volkswagen&docid=59985&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=66367#ctx1|publisher=European Court of Justice|access-date=13 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044955/http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=Volkswagen&docid=59985&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=66367#ctx1|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 13 February 2007, [[Advocate General]] [[Dámaso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer]] submitted an opinion to the court in support of the action.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6356787.stm |title=Top EU court finds against VW law |work=BBC News |date=13 February 2007 |access-date=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206031746/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6356787.stm |archive-date=6 December 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> This again opened the possibility of a hostile takeover of VW and so on 26 March of the same year Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen shares to 30.9%.

==== Brazilian market ====
[[File:Brazilian Kombi pair.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Kombi]] was produced in Brazil from 1957 up to 2013.]]
The brand has a notable history in [[Brazil]]. Volkswagen's relationship with Brazil dates back to the early 1950s. In 1956, Volkswagen began by building a plant in [[São Bernardo do Campo]], near [[São Paulo]] as its first manufacturing plant outside Germany as a response to the Brazil's ban on the import of [[Built up export|completely assembled vehicles]] in 1950.<ref name="stray brazil">{{Cite web|title=A Stray Branch of Volkswagen Evolution Found in Brazil|url=https://dyler.com/posts/99/a-stray-branch-of-volkswagen-evolution-found-in-brazil|access-date=12 September 2020|website=dyler.com|language=en}}</ref> One year later, the plant started to produce the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Kombi]] model – 370 cars at that time, with a 50 percent local content component share. Of 81 million vehicles produced over six decades in Brazil, 23 million of it was built by Volkswagen, which was produced by four passenger car factories in the country. In 2018, Volkswagen accounted for close on 15 percent of the Brazilian car market.<ref name="brazil comeback">{{Cite web|title=Great comeback in Brazil|url=https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com:443/en/stories/great-comeback-in-brazil-4608|access-date=12 September 2020|website=Volkswagen Newsroom|language=en}}</ref>

The importance of the Brazilian market gave birth to several models developed and manufactured by [[Volkswagen do Brasil]], which include the [[Volkswagen Fox|Fox]], [[Volkswagen Gol|Gol]], [[Volkswagen Nivus|Nivus]], [[Volkswagen Gol#Saveiro|Saveiro]], [[Volkswagen Polo#Volkswagen Virtus|Virtus]] and [[Volkswagen Gol#Voyage|Voyage]]. These models are also typically exported throughout Latin America.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F053242-0034, Hannover, Messe.jpg|thumb|right| VW pure [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] prototype car developed by [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] in 1978.]]

[[Volkswagen do Brasil]] produced and sold pure ethanol-powered ([[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|E100 only]]) vehicles in Brazil, and production was discontinued only after they were supplanted by more modern [[flexible-fuel vehicle|Flex Fuel]] technology. As a response to the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as a fuel, and the [[Pro-Álcool|National Alcohol Program]] -''Pró-Álcool''- ({{lang-pt|Programa Nacional do Álcool}}) was launched in 1975.<ref name="Bastos">{{cite web|url=http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 |author=Milton Briquet Bastos |title=Brazil's Ethanol Program – An Insider's View |work=Energy Tribune |date=20 June 2007 |access-date=14 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710193215/http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 |archive-date=10 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Veja1979" /><ref name="SeatleT" /> Compelled by the [[1979 energy crisis]], and after development and testing with government fleets by the [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology|CTA]] at [[São José dos Campos]], and further testing of several prototypes developed by the four local carmakers, including Volkswagen do Brasil, pure ethanol vehicles were launched in the Brazilian market.<ref name="Bastos" /><ref name="Veja1979">{{cite web |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/petroleo/130679.html |title=O petróleo da cana |author=Revista Veja |publisher=[[Editora Abril]] |date=13 June 1979 |access-date=29 November 2008 |language=pt |author-link=Revista Veja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006165850/http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/petroleo/130679.html |archive-date=6 October 2008 }}</ref> Petrol engines were modified to support [[hydrous]] ethanol characteristics and changes included [[compression ratio]], amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder [[spark plugs]] suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects petrol from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.

Production and sales of pure ethanol vehicles tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a sharp decline in petrol prices as a result of the [[1980s oil glut]], and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid-1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at petrol stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.<ref name="SeatleT">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002339093_brazilfuel17.html |work=The Seattle Times |title=Brazil's ethanol effort helping lead to oil self-sufficiency |author=Marla Dickerson |date=17 June 2005 |access-date=29 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227203948/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002339093_brazilfuel17.html |archive-date=27 December 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Veja1989">{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/arquivo_veja/capa_24051989.shtml |title=Um sonho corroído |author=Revista Veja |publisher=[[Editora Abril]] |date=24 May 1989 |access-date=29 November 2008 |language=pt |author-link=Revista Veja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208192704/http://veja.abril.com.br/arquivo_veja/capa_24051989.shtml |archive-date=8 February 2009 }}</ref>

In 1974 Volkswagen paid a $120,000 fine to settle a complaint filed by the Environmental Protection Agency over the use of so-called "defeat devices" that disabled certain pollution-control systems. The complaint said the use of the devices violated the US Clean Air Act.<ref>{{cite web|title=VW had previous run-in over 'defeat devices'|date=23 September 2015|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/23/vw-had-previous-run-in-over-defeat-devices.html|publisher=CNBC|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013174105/http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/23/vw-had-previous-run-in-over-defeat-devices.html|archive-date=13 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1996, Volkswagen first implemented its seven environmental goals in Technical Development with themes involving climate protection, resource conservation, and healthcare, through objectives such as reducing greenhouse emissions and fuel consumption, enabling alternative fuels, and avoiding hazardous materials.<ref name=Volkswagen_Environment>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagen.com/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/en2/unternehmen/mobility_and_sustainability0/management___daten/management_und_verantwortung/Umweltziele.html |title=Volkswagen Environmental |author=Volkswagen |publisher=Volkswagen |date=12 December 2010 |access-date=12 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226110727/http://www.volkswagen.com/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/en2/unternehmen/mobility_and_sustainability0/management___daten/management_und_verantwortung/Umweltziele.html |archive-date=26 February 2011 }}</ref> The goals have been revised in 2002 and 2007.

In 2011, [[Greenpeace]] began criticising Volkswagen's opposition to legislation requiring tighter controls on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy efficiency, and launched an advertising campaign parodying VW's series of ''[[Star Wars]]''–based commercials.<ref name=Volkswagen_Environment /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vwdarkside.com |title=Volkswagen.
