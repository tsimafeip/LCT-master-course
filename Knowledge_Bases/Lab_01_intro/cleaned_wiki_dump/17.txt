Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent "people's car" projects&nbsp;– Mercedes Benz 130 Mercedes 170H, BMW 3/15, Adler 2.5 litre Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 50 Steyr 55, and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.

The growing trend was not nascent; Béla Barényi, a pioneering automotive engineer, is credited as already having conceived basic design during mid 1920s. Josef Ganz developed Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as "German Volkswagen").

Ferdinand Porsche, a well known designer for high end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family.  He built a car named "Volksauto" from ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air cooled rear Internal combustion engine#Reciprocating engines engine, torsion bar suspension, and a "beetle" shape, front bonnet rounded for better aerodynamics (necessary as it had a small engine).  name SmallWonder> book Nelson Walter title Small Wonder year 1967 publisher Little, Brown & Company page 333 >

It soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only RM990.  Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all new, state owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design suggestions, including an air cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that German families could buy car through a savings scheme ("lang de Fünf Mark die Woche musst du sparen, willst du im eigenen Wagen fahren"&nbsp;– "Five Marks a week you must set aside, if in your own car you wish to ride"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into. >König, Wolfgang.

In April 1945, KdF Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by United States Armed Forces United States armed forces and subsequently handed over to British, within whose British Occupation zone in Germany occupation zone town and factory fell. The factory was placed under control of British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers REME, a civilian Military Governor with occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for List of military vehicles military vehicle maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain.

One of factory's wartime 'KdF Wagen' cars had been taken to factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around factory, and some parts (such as carburetor carburettors) were unavailable. Hirst and his German assistant Heinrich Nordhoff (who went on to run Wolfsburg facility after military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilise acute social situation while simultaneously re establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his engineering experience to arrange manufacture of carburettors, original producers being effectively 'lost' in East Germany Soviet zone. > journal last1 Porter first1 Lindsay title Mr journal Thoroughbred & Classic Cars date October 1986 > The first few hundred cars went to personnel from occupying forces, and to Australia Post.

The car and its town changed their Second World War era names to "Volkswagen" and "Wolfsburg" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of factory. It was offered to representatives from American, Australian, British, and French motor industries who all rejected it. After an inspection of plant, William Edward Rootes, 1st Baron Rootes Sir William Rootes, head of British Rootes Group, told Hirst project would fail within two years, and that car "...is quite unattractive to average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy ...

From 1948, Volkswagen became an important element, symbolically and economically, of Wirtschaftswunder West German regeneration.according to whom date July 2017 Heinrich Nordhoff (1899–1968), a former senior manager at Opel who had overseen civilian and military vehicle production in 1930s and 1940s, was recruited to run factory in 1948.

Apart from introduction of Volkswagen Type 2 commercial vehicle (van, pick up, and camper), and Volkswagen Karmann Ghia VW Karmann Ghia sports car, Nordhoff pursued one model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.

Volkswagens were first exhibited and sold in United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to US market, VW was briefly sold as a Victory Wagon. Volkswagen Group of America Volkswagen of America was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in United States. Production of Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over years, total reaching one million in 1955.

The 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36&nbsp;hp 1200cc four cylinder air cooled flat four opposed OHV engine made of aluminium alloy block and heads. By 1966, Type 1 came with a 1300cc engine. By 1967 Type 1 had a 1500cc engine, and 1600cc in 1970. The air cooled engine lost favour in United States market with advent of unleaded petrol and smog controls. These air cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel rich in order to control engine over heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on US West Coast where limited capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularised on US West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.

VW expanded its product line in 1961 with introduction of four Volkswagen Type 3 Type 3 models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in United States for Variant.

In 1969 larger Volkswagen Type 4 Type 4 (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with notable introduction of monocoque/unibody construction, option of a fully automatic transmission, electronic fuel injection, and a sturdier powerplant.

In 1964, Volkswagen acquired Auto Union, and in 1969, NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU). The former company owned historic Audi brand, which had disappeared after Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its luxury vehicle marque. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air cooled models went into decline.

Volkswagen added a "Super Beetle" > web  Dean  Wayne  date 28 October 2006  url  title History of Super Beetle  publisher superbeetles.com  access date 6 May 2015  archive url  archive date 6 May 2015    > (Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension (vehicle) suspension instead of usual torsion beam suspension torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in model year 1975 and up. The front of car was stretched convert 2 in mm to allow spare tire to lie flat, and combination of these two features increased usable front luggage space.

In 1973, Volkswagen introduced military themed Volkswagen 181 Type 181, or "Trekker" in Europe, "Thing" in America, recalling wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for NATO era German Army during Cold War years of 1970 to 1979. The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.

Volkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973. >William Beaver (Nov–Dec 1992). [Volkswagen's American assembly plant  Fahrvergnugen was not enough – international marketing] Find Articles; Business Horizons. > The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than Beetle and NSU Motorenwerke AG NSU based K70 also failed to sell. Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/Auto Union proved beneficial. Its expertise in front wheel drive, and water cooling water cooled engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved way for this new generation of Volkswagens  Passat, Scirocco, Volkswagen Golf Golf, and Polo.

First in series was Volkswagen Passat (Dasher in US), introduced in 1973, a fastback version of Audi 80, using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.

In spring 1974, Volkswagen Scirocco Scirocco followed. The coupe was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Based on platform of not yet released Volkswagen Golf Golf, it was built at Karmann due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.

The pivotal model emerged as Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in United States and Canada as Rabbit for 1st generation (1975–1985) and 5th generation (2006–2009). Its angular styling was designed by Italian Giorgetto Giugiaro. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by 1959 Mini&nbsp;– Golf had a transverse engine transversely mounted, water cooled engine in front, driving front wheels, and had a hatchback, a format that has dominated market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories (Hanover and Emden) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.

In 1975, Volkswagen Polo followed. It was a re badged Audi 50, which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became base of Volkswagen Derby, which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a Three box styling three box design of Polo. After a second model generation, Derby was discontinued in 1985, although body style lived on in form of polo classic/polo saloon until 1991.

Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built basis for Volkswagen's turn around.

While Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European car makers, Golf has been mainstay of Volkswagen line up since its introduction, and mechanical basis for several other cars of company. There have been eight generations of Volkswagen Golf, first of which was produced from summer of 1974 until autumn of 1983 (sold as Rabbit in United States and Canada and as Caribe in Latin America).

Volkswagen maintained North American sales of 224,195 in 2005. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with introduction of new models, production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 Volkswagen Eos Eos, a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and Brazilian factory in Curitiba, where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (Volkswagen Jetta Jetta has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989).

Volkswagen partnered with Daimler AG and other companies to market BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands. According to United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of ten most fuel efficient vehicles available for sale in United States are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines. > web  url  title Fuel Economy of New Diesel Cars  year 2012  website Fueleconomy.gov  publisher United States Environmental Protection Agency  access date 5 December 2012  archive url  archive date 17 January 2013    > Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine, which lends class leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel.citation needed date December 2012 For 2007 model year, however, strict US government emissions regulations had forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their US engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to US standards returned to American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post 2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a sport utility vehicle SUV to its lineup, but relented with introduction of Volkswagen Touareg Touareg, made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on Porsche Cayenne and later Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third row seat, relatively poor fuel economy, and high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from "Concept A" concept vehicle introduced at 2006 Geneva Auto Show, and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that new vehicle called Volkswagen Tiguan Tiguan.

Since discontinuation of T4 in 2003 and decision not to export T5 to United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched Volkswagen Routan, a badge engineering badge engineered Dodge Caravan Dodge Grand Caravan made for American and Canadian markets, in 2008.

In September 2006, Volkswagen began offering Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 "City Golf (Golf City in 2009)" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China City Golf and City Jetta only for Canadian market. Both models were originally Volkswagen Golf Mk4 Mk4 Golf and Jetta but were later replaced with Brazilian versions of Golf Mk4 and Volkswagen Bora Bora. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.

Relationship with Porsche and Volkswagen Law
Volkswagen has always had a close relationship with Porsche, Stuttgart Zuffenhausen based sports car manufacturer founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, original Volkswagen designer and Volkswagen company co founder, hired by Adolf Hitler for project. The first Porsche car, Porsche 64 of 1938, used many components from Volkswagen Beetle. The 1948 Porsche 356 continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, gearbox and suspension.

The two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make Porsche 914 VW Porsche 914 and Porsche 914 6. (The 914 6 had a 6 cylinder Porsche engine, and standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on Porsche 912 E (USA only) and Porsche 924, which used many Audi components and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most Porsche 944 models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.

The Porsche Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7, and is built at same Volkswagen factory in Bratislava that other SUVs are built.

Production and sales of pure ethanol vehicles tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a sharp decline in petrol prices as a result of 1980s oil glut, and high sugar prices in world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid 1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in local market left thousands of vehicles in line at petrol stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.  name "SeatleT"> web url  work The Seattle Times  title Brazil's ethanol effort helping lead to oil self sufficiency  author Marla Dickerson  date 17 June 2005  access date 29 November 2008    archive url  archive date 27 December 2008  >  name "Veja1989"> web url  title Um sonho corroído  author Revista Veja  publisher Editora Abril  date 24 May 1989  access date 29 November 2008  language pt  author link Revista Veja    archive url  archive date 8 February 2009  >
