Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he won a [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics|club-record]] 35 trophies, including ten [[La Liga]] titles, seven [[Copa del Rey]] titles and four [[UEFA Champions League]]s. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for [[List of La Liga top scorers#All-time top scorers|most goals in La Liga]] (474), [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers by season|a La Liga]] and European league season (50), [[List of La Liga hat-tricks|most hat-tricks in La Liga]] (36) and the [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|UEFA Champions League]] (8), and most [[Assist (association football)|assists]] in La Liga (192), a [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers by season|La Liga]] season (21) and the [[Copa América]] (17). He also holds the record for [[List of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals|most international goals]] by a South American male (81). Messi has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|750 senior career goals]] for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.

Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in [[2008–09 FC Barcelona season|2008–09]] he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Messi makes it four FIFA Ballon d'Or wins in a row |url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1910623.html |work=UEFA |date=7 January 2013 |access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> During the [[2011–12 FC Barcelona season|2011–12 season]], he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]]. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the [[Ballon d'Or]] behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (his perceived [[Messi–Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]), before regaining his best form during the [[2014–15 FC Barcelona season|2014–15 campaign]], becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]]. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.

An Argentine international, Messi is both his country's [[Argentina national football team#Most capped players|highest appearance-maker]] and their [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa América]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and [[Copa América Centenario|2016 Copa América]], winning the [[2015 Copa América#Awards|Golden Ball]] in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa América]], and won the [[2021 Copa América]], while winning the [[2021 Copa América#Awards|Golden Ball]] and [[Copa América records and statistics|Golden Boot]] award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record [[2021 Ballon d'Or|seventh Ballon d'Or]] in 2021.

Messi has endorsed sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019. Messi was among [[Time 100|''Time'']]'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]], thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.

== Early life ==

Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]],'''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Messi {{!}} Ficha del jugador 20/21 {{!}} Delantero |url=https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/futbol/primer-equipo/jugadores/4974/lionel-messi|access-date=1 June 2021|work=FC Barcelona|language=es}}</ref>''' the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] [[Marche]] region of [[Italy]] and [[Catalonia]], and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=32–37}} Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, [[Maxi Biancucchi|Maximiliano]] and [[Emanuel Biancucchi]], both of whom became professional footballers.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=9–10}} At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.<ref name="MagicFeet">{{cite news |first=John |last=Carlin |title=Lionel Messi: Magic in His Feet |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 March 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-magic-in-his-feet-1928768.html |access-date=18 July 2015 |archive-date=5 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705210947/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-magic-in-his-feet-1928768.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=44–45}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Maume |title=Lionel Messi: The World at His Feet |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 July 2014 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-the-world-at-his-feet-9601215.html |access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref>

A lifelong supporter of [[Newell's Old Boys]], Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.<ref name="Here">{{cite web |first=Wright |last=Thompson |title=Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina |work=ESPN |date=22 October 2012 |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/eticket/story?page=Lionel-Messi |access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=31–35}} However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a [[growth hormone deficiency]].

[[File:La Masia (Can Planas) (Barcelona) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, [[La Masia]], at age 13.]]

As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in September 2000. First team director [[Carles Rexach|Charly Rexach]] immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.<ref name="Mission"/><ref name="Serviette">{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=Lionel Messi: How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 October 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/15/lionel-messi-barcelona-decade |access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref> In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, [[Camp Nou]]. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the ''Infantiles'' due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.<ref name="Here"/><ref name="Serviette"/><ref name="BoyGenius">{{cite news |first=Jeré |last=Longman |title=Lionel Messi: Boy Genius |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 May 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-boy-genius.html |access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref>

After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, [[La Masia]], Messi was finally enrolled in the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were [[Cesc Fàbregas]] and [[Gerard Piqué]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=61–62}} After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=149}} Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the ''Cadetes'' A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=61–62}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Jenson |title=Fàbregas, Messi, Piqué: Class of 2002 |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 March 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fabregas-messi-pique-class-of-2002-1928682.html |access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref> The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], became known in club lore as the ''partido de la máscara'', the final of the mask.

As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.<ref name="Burden">{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Himmelman |title=The Burden of Being Messi |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 June 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/magazine/the-burden-of-being-messi.html |access-date=11 August 2015}}</ref> Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, [[Carles Rexach]], alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]]. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championship]].{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=209–219}}

Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=220–240}}<ref name="MagicMessi">{{cite web |title=Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands |publisher=FIFA |date=July 2005 |url=https://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/y=2007/m=3/news=magic-messi-sparks-high-drama-the-lowlands-501784.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906082949/http://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/y=2007/m=3/news=magic-messi-sparks-high-drama-the-lowlands-501784.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 September 2015 |access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref> His performances drew comparisons with compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who had led Argentina to the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship|title in 1979]].<ref name="MagicMessi" />

=== 2008–2011: Collective decline ===
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=384–387}} Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], securing their place in the tournament only after defeating [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]].<ref name="Century" />{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533–539}} During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Chadband |title=Lionel Messi Can Achieve More at Barcelona than Diego Maradona |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 April 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/5231676/Lionel-Messi-can-achieve-more-at-Barcelona-than-Diego-Maradona.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/5231676/Lionel-Messi-can-achieve-more-at-Barcelona-than-Diego-Maradona.html |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |access-date=13 August 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.<ref name="Century" /> Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=155–156, 405–406}}

[[File:Messi Copa America 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Messi in action during the opening match against Bolivia at the [[2011 Copa América]]]]

Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533–539}} He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against [[Greece national football team|Greece]]; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rory |last=Smith |title=Greece 0 Argentina 2: Match Report |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 June 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/news/7842201/Greece-0-Argentina-2-match-report.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/news/7842201/Greece-0-Argentina-2-match-report.html |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |access-date=13 August 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564–567}} FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adidas Golden Ball Nominees Announced |publisher=FIFA |date=9 July 2010 |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=7/news=adidas-golden-ball-nominees-announced-1270753.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411063638/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=7/news=adidas-golden-ball-nominees-announced-1270753.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 April 2015 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably [[1986 FIFA World Cup|did in 1986]], but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}

Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false nine]] within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}<ref name="NewRole">{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Cox |title=Lionel Messi Showing Some Promising Signs in a New Argentina Role |publisher=ESPN FC |date=13 November 2014 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/2144957/argentina-national-team-lionel-messi-showing-some-promising-signs-in-a-new-argentina-role |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.<ref name="Matches 2010–11" /><ref name="Century" /> Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the [[2011 Copa América]], hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker [[Carlos Tevez]], who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}

[[File:Suisse vs Argentine - Granit Xhaka & Lionel Messi crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Messi scored his first international [[hat-trick]] against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in 2012]]

After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by [[Alejandro Sabella]]. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain [[Javier Mascherano]]. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=595–602}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Hughes |title=If Messi Is Argentina's Star, Then Mascherano Is the Glue |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 July 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/sports/soccer/if-messi-is-argentinas-star-then-mascherano-is-the-glue.html |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games.

Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.<ref name="Century" />{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=595–602}} He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by [[Gabriel Batistuta]] for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Adamson |title=Lionel Messi's Incredible Record-Breaking Year in Numbers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 December 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/10/lionel-messi-record-year-numbers |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]]. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta.

Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol [[Pablo Aimar]], to receive the "[[New Maradona]]" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.<ref name="Aimar" />{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533–539}} [[Jorge Valdano]], who won the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, "Messi is Maradona every day.

In Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.<ref name="Burden" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Jeré |last=Longman |title=Adept?

To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.<ref>{{cite web |title=Messi Shares Baby Joy |publisher=beIN Sports |date=17 June 2012 |url=http://www.beinsports.tv/news/title/messi-shares-baby-joy/article/3my803vek9sw1ky0beeucau3b |archive-url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-lZWZO2a5XMJ:www.beinsports.tv/news/title/messi-shares-baby-joy/article/3my803vek9sw1ky0beeucau3b&hl=en&gl=nl&strip=1&vwsrc=0 |archive-date=19 August 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training.<ref>{{cite web |title=Messi Junior Named Thiago |publisher=ESPN FC |date=2 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1211817/messi-becomes-a-father-son-named-thiago |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref> Thiago's name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf.{{sfn|Caioli|2015|loc=ch. 38}} In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lionel Messi's Wife Expecting Second Child, Barcelona Star Says |publisher=ESPN FC |date=30 April 2015 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/barcelona/story/2426028/lionel-messis-wife-expecting-second-child-barca-star-says |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref> He missed training ahead of a match against Atlético Madrid to attend the birth of his second son, Mateo, on 11 September 2015 in Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web |title=Messi's Brother Confirms Birth of Barcelona Star's Second Child |work=FourFourTwo |date=11 September 2015 |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/messis-brother-confirms-birth-barcelona-stars-second-child |access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref> On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.ie/style/weddings/lionel-messi-marries-stunning-childhood-sweetheart-antonella-roccuzzo-in-argentine-home-town-35883938.html |title=Lionel Messi marries stunning childhood sweetheart Antonella Roccuzzo in Argentine home town |access-date=1 July 2017 |newspaper=Irish Independent}}</ref> On 15 October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/3230393/lionel-messi-and-wife-antonella-roccuzzo-expecting-their-third-child |title=Lionel Messi and wife Antonella Roccuzzo expecting their third child |publisher=ESPN FC |date=15 October 2017|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> On 10 March 2018, Messi skipped the match against Málaga after Ciro was born.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-announces-arrival-of-third-child-after-withdrawing/6lclw0po6hsg1jjbc5ckl603l |title=Barcelona news: Lionel Messi announces arrival of third child after withdrawing from squad to face Malaga |access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref>

Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=31, 143, 570}}

Since leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of "The Machine of '87" at Newell's Old Boys. He currently lives in [[Castelldefels]], a village near Barcelona. Although considered a [[List of one-club men in association football|one-club man]], he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.<ref name="Here" />{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Wright |title=After Just 72 Hours on the Planet, Thiago Messi Signs for Newell's Old Boys |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/1850358/after-just-72-hours-on-the-planet-thiago-messi-signs-for-newells-old-boys |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref>

=== Philanthropy ===
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.<ref name="Leo Messi: Goodwill Ambassador">{{cite web |title=Leo Messi: Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=UNICEF |date=25 May 2012 |url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_52964.html |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Iain |last1=Rogers |first2=Justin |last2=Palmer |title=Barcelona Extend UNICEF Shirt Deal to 2016 |work=Reuters |date=12 November 2013 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-spain-barcelona-unicef-idUSBRE9AB0NZ20131112 |access-date=25 August 2015 |archive-date=24 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124194912/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/12/us-soccer-spain-barcelona-unicef-idUSBRE9AB0NZ20131112}}</ref> Messi has served as a [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF goodwill ambassador]] since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|recent earthquake]].

In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lionel Messi Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |date=25 June 2015 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/08/world/europe/lionel-messi-fast-facts/ |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref> It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}} Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Ooredoo, Messi Foundation Continue Expansion: Three New Mobile Health Clinics Launched in Algeria |newspaper=Arab Times |date=3 August 2015 |url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/ooredoo-messi-foundation-continue-expansion/ |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref> In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global "Messi and Friends" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.<ref>{{cite web |title='Lionel Messi and Friends' Soccer Tour Is One of Many Causes Argentine Superstar Supports |publisher=New England Sports Network |date=22 June 2012 |url=http://nesn.com/2012/06/lionel-messi-and-friends-soccer-tour-is-one-of-many-causes-argentine-superstar-supports/ |access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Partners |publisher=Leo Messi Foundation |url=http://www.fundacionleomessi.org/nuestros-partners/ |access-date=25 August 2015 |archive-date=18 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318214259/http://www.fundacionleomessi.org/nuestros-partners/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club [[Rosario Central]], as well as at [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Boca Juniors]] in Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}} At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's [[Estadio Marcelo Bielsa|stadium]] for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.<ref name="Here" /> On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against [[La Razón (Madrid)|''La Razón'' newspaper]] and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/story/2887818/argentinas-lionel-messi-wins-libel-case-and-donates-damages-to-charity |title=Argentina's Lionel Messi wins libel case, donates damages to charity |publisher=ESPN FC |date=7 June 2016}}</ref> Messi made a donation worth €1&nbsp;million ($1.1&nbsp;million) to fight the [[COVID-19 pandemic|spread of coronavirus]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Messi, Guardiola donate $1.08 million each to coronavirus battle |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-soccer-spain/messi-guardiola-donate-1-08-million-each-to-coronavirus-battle-idUSKBN21B3HV |work=Reuters |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in [[Barcelona, Spain]] and his native Argentina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfsb.com/cristiano-ronaldo-and-lionel-messi-donate-to-hospitals-in-fight-against-coronavirus/article_1c669479-5ee2-5bb5-8ebd-77b9af3f36e2.html|title=Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi donate to hospitals in fight against coronavirus|first=Matias |last=Grez|work=WFSB|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref> In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow [[FC Barcelona]] teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|2020 coronavirus emergency]], and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2020/03/30/lionel-messis-coronavirus-wage-cut-could-cost-him-50-million/|title=Lionel Messi's Coronavirus Wage Cut Could Cost Him $50 Million|first=Christina|last=Settimi|work=Forbes|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>

In November 2016, with the [[Argentine Football Association]] being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.<ref>{{cite news |title=Argentina federation to have affairs managed by emergency FIFA panel |newspaper=ESPN FC |date=24 June 2016 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/fifa/243/post/2901179/argentina-federation-to-have-affairs-managed-by-emergency-fifa-panel}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Messi paid the salaries of Argentina's security team |newspaper=Marca |location=Spain |date=18 November 2016 |url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2016/11/18/582f53b822601d46758b4610.html}}</ref> In February 2021, Messi donated his Adidas shoes to the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club, the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sport|date=12 February 2021|title=Adidas and Messi donate boots to Art Museum to be auctioned in April|url=https://www.sport.es/en/news/barca/adidas-and-messi-donate-boots-to-art-museum-to-be-auctioned-in-april-11514617|access-date=13 February 2021|work=Sport}}</ref>

In advance of the [[2021 Copa América]] in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm [[Sinovac Biotech]]—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's [[COVID-19 vaccine]], [[CoronaVac]], in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.<ref name="Vac" /> A deal brokered by Uruguay's president [[Luis Lacalle Pou]], the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of [[Canelones, Uruguay|Canelones]] in Uruguay remarking that "Just as the president manifested cooperation with [[CONMEBOL]] to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones".<ref name="Vac">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/14/lionel-messi-helps-obtain-50000-covid-vaccines-for-south-american-players|title=Lionel Messi helps obtain 50,000 Covid vaccines for South American players|first=Goni|last=Uki|work=The Guardian|date=14 April 2021|access-date=16 April 2021}}</ref>

=== Tax fraud ===
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected [[tax evasion]]. Offshore companies in [[tax haven]]s Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1&nbsp;million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated [[shell company]] in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the [[Panama Papers]] data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1&nbsp;million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7&nbsp;million and €1.4&nbsp;million in fines.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/07/06/lionel-messi-tax-fraud-prison-jail-sentence |title=Messi, father guilty of tax fraud, given suspended 21-month sentences |work=Sports Illustrated |date=6 July 2016 |access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref> Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football.
