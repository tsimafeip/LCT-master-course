Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid, While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid, In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto right flank to receive ball, and be more involved in build up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid.
