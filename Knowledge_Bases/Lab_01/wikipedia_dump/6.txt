He worked as a [[KGB]] foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of [[Podpolkovnik|lieutenant colonel]], before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. He moved to [[Moscow]] in 1996 to join the administration of president [[Boris Yeltsin]]. He briefly served as director of the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) and secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia|Security Council]], before being appointed as prime minister in August 1999.

He was [[2004 Russian presidential election|reelected in 2004]].

According to an anonymous source, a former RAF member, at one of these meetings in Dresden the militants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to the RAF in [[West Germany]]. Klaus Zuchold, who claimed to be recruited by Putin, said that Putin handled a neo-Nazi, Rainer Sonntag, and attempted to recruit an author of a study on poisons.<ref name="politico1" /> Putin reportedly met Germans to be recruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter. He was involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due to trips of German engineers, recruited by him, there and to the West.<ref name="hoffman" />

According to Putin's official biography, during the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] that began on 9 November 1989, he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural Center (House of Friendship) and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official authorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators, including KGB and Stasi agents, from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly burnt only the KGB files, in a few hours, but saved the archives of the Soviet Cultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the selection criteria during this burning; for example, concerning Stasi files or about files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the USSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the furnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-runner-up-vladimir-putin/|title=Vladimir Putin, The Imperialist|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=11 December 2014|date=10 December 2014}}</ref>

After the [[Die Wende|collapse of the Communist East German government]], Putin was to resign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his loyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier, though the KGB and the [[Soviet Army]] still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in early 1990 as a member of the "active reserves", where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]], reporting to Vice-Rector [[Yuriy Molchanov]], while working on his doctoral dissertation.<ref name="hoffman" />

In May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of Leningrad [[Anatoly Sobchak]]. In a [[The Putin Interviews|2017 interview]] with [[Oliver Stone]], Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |title=The Putin Interviews (Party 2 – 2:10) |url=https://www.sho.com/the-putin-interviews |website=sho.com |publisher=Showtime |access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref> According to Putin's statements in 2018 and 2021, he may have worked as a private [[Taxicab driver|taxi driver]] to earn extra money, or considered such a job.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/vladimir-putin-says-he-drove-a-taxi-after-fall-of-soviet-union/a-60097866|title=Vladimir Putin says he drove a taxi after fall of Soviet Union|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=12 December 2021|access-date=18 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Andrew|date=13 December 2021|title=Vladimir Putin says he resorted to driving a taxi after fall of Soviet Union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/vladimir-putin-says-he-resorted-to-taxi-driving-after-fall-of-soviet-union|access-date=19 December 2021|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

In March 1994, Putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the [[Politics of Saint Petersburg|Government of Saint Petersburg]]. In May 1995, he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government [[Our Home – Russia]] political party, the [[Liberalism in Russia|liberal]] [[party of power]] founded by Prime Minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]]. In 1995, he managed the [[1995 Russian legislative election|legislative election campaign]] for that party, and from 1995 through June 1997, he was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch.<ref name="30bio" />

=== 1996–1999: Early Moscow career ===

In June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for reelection in Saint Petersburg, and Putin, who had led his election campaign, resigned from his positions in the city administration. He moved to Moscow and was appointed as deputy chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by [[Pavel Borodin]]. He occupied this position until March 1997. He was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and the CPSU to the Russian Federation.<ref name=Vlast />

On 16 August, the [[State Duma]] approved his appointment as prime minister with 233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/422001.stm |title=Yeltsin's man wins approval |work=BBC News|date=16 August 1999 |access-date=22 June 2013}}</ref> while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth prime minister in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration.<ref>{{harv|Sakwa|2008|p=20}}</ref>

Yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Following the [[Russian apartment bombings]] and the [[War of Dagestan|invasion]] of [[Daghestan|Dagestan]] by [[mujahideen]], including the former KGB agents, based in the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], Putin's [[law and order (politics)|law-and-order]] image and unrelenting approach to the [[Second Chechen War]] soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.

While not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed [[Unity (Russian political party)|Unity Party]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Unity |title=Political groups and parties |access-date=2 July 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010702200941/http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Unity |archive-date=2 July 2001 }} Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt</ref> which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the [[1999 Russian legislative election|December 1999 Duma elections]], and in turn supported Putin.

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Tom Brokaw-1.jpg|thumb|Putin with [[Tom Brokaw]] before an interview on 2 June 2000]]
The first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the [[Kursk submarine disaster|''Kursk'' submarine disaster]].<ref name=Kursk>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1487112.stm Spectre of Kursk haunts Putin]. [[BBC News]]. 12 August 2001. Retrieved 30 August 2020.</ref> That criticism was largely because it took several days for Putin to return from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.<ref name=Kursk />

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the [[Russian oligarch]]s, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for—and alignment with—Putin's government.<ref>{{harv|Sakwa|2008|pp=143–150}}</ref><ref>''Playing Russian Roulette: Putin in search of good governance'', by Andre Mommen, in ''Good Governance in the Era of Global Neoliberalism: Conflict and Depolitisation in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa'', by Jolle Demmers, Alex E.

The [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] occurred in October 2002. Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the crisis would severely damage President Putin's popularity. However, shortly after the siege had ended, the Russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings—83% of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege.<ref>Wyatt, Caroline (16 December 2002).

Putin was barred from a third consecutive term by the [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]]. First Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was elected his successor.

Putin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis was one of the two main achievements of his second premiership.<ref name=bbc-demography /> The other was [[Demographics of Russia|stabilizing the size of Russia's population]] between 2008 and 2011 following a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.<ref name=bbc-demography />

At the [[United Russia]] Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the presidency in 2012, an offer Putin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming prime minister at the end of his presidential term.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15045816|title=Russia's Putin set to return as president in 2012|date=24 September 2011|access-date=24 September 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref>

Putin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical [[power structure]]. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree organizing the 89 [[federal subjects of Russia]] into seven administrative [[Federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).<ref>{{cite book|author1=World Freedom Foundation|title=Vladimir Putin – Direct Speech Without Cuts|date=2015|isbn=978-1-329-39092-8|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjAyCgAAQBAJ}}</ref>

[[File:Map of Russian districts, 2016-07-28.svg|thumb|In May 2000, Putin introduced seven [[Federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] for administrative purposes. In January 2010, the 8th [[North Caucasus Federal District]] (shown here in purple) was split from the [[Southern Federal District]]. In March 2014, the new 9th [[Crimean Federal District]] was formed after the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]]. In July 2016, it was incorporated into the Southern Federal District.]]
According to [[Stephen K. White|Stephen White]], under the presidency of Putin, Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a "second edition" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Stephen|editor1-first=Stephen|editor1-last=White|title=Developments in Russian Politics 7|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-22449-0|chapter=Classifying Russia's Politics}}</ref> Some commentators have described Putin's administration as a "[[sovereign democracy]]".<ref>{{harv|Sakwa|2008|pp= 42–43}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Okara|first1=Andrei|title=Sovereign Democracy: A New Russian Idea Or a PR Project?|journal=Russia in Global Affairs|date=July–September 2007|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://kms2.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/RESSpecNet/39702/ichaptersection_singledocument/576378B1-E97E-4EC1-9894-FB6F430EA76E/en/02+Sover+Democracy.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410080227/http://kms2.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/RESSpecNet/39702/ichaptersection_singledocument/576378B1-E97E-4EC1-9894-FB6F430EA76E/en/02+Sover+Democracy.pdf|archive-date=10 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Petrov|first1=Nikolai|title=From Managed Democracy to Sovereign Democracy|date=December 2005|url=https://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/ponars/pm_0396.pdf|publisher=Center for Political-Geographic Research}}</ref> According to the proponents of that description (primarily [[Vladislav Surkov]]), the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edinros.ru/news.html?id=111148|title=Sovereignty is a Political Synonym of Competitiveness|last=Surkov|first=Vladislav|date=7 February 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212215743/http://www.edinros.ru/news.html?id=111148|archive-date=12 February 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>

The practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist [[Anders Åslund]] as manual management, commenting: "After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as 'manual management' as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/the-illusions-of-putin-s-russia|title=The Illusions of Putin's Russia|last=Åslund|first=Anders|website=Atlantic Council|date=6 May 2019|access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref>

The period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws. In July 2000, according to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. In 2004, the direct election of those [[List of current heads of federal subjects of Russia|heads (usually called "governors")]] by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures.<ref>Lynch, Dov (2005).

[[Sergey Guriyev]], when talking about Putin's economic policy, divided it into four distinct periods: the "reform" years of his first term (1999–2003); the "statist" years of his second term (2004 – the first half of 2008); the world economic crisis and recovery (the second half of 2008–2013); and the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia's growing isolation from the global economy, and stagnation (2014–present).<ref>{{cite web|last=Guriyev|first=Sergey|author-link=Sergei Guriev|date=16 August 2019|title=20 Years of Vladimir Putin: The Transformation of the Economy|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/16/20-years-of-vladimir-putin-the-transformation-of-the-economy-a66854|access-date=15 October 2020|website=[[The Moscow Times]]}}</ref>

In 2004, Putin signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>''The New York Times''. 6 November 2004. Retrieved 20 April 2008.</ref> However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/13640/g8s_gradual_move_toward_postkyoto_climate_change_policy.html|title=G8's Gradual Move toward Post-Kyoto Climate Change Policy|author=Tony Johnson|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2 March 2010|archive-date=29 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229130613/http://www.cfr.org/publication/13640/g8s_gradual_move_toward_postkyoto_climate_change_policy.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Putin regularly attends the most important services of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] on the main holy days, and has established a good relationship with [[Patriarchs of Moscow|Patriarchs]] of the Russian Church, the late [[Alexy II of Moscow]] and the current [[Kirill of Moscow]]. As president, Putin took an active personal part in promoting the [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate]], signed 17 May 2007, which restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] after the 80-year schism.<ref>{{cite press release|title=The President of Russia attended the ceremonial signing of the Act on Canonical Communion that was held in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour|publisher=[[Embassy of Russia in Ottawa]]|date=17 May 2007|url=http://www.rusembcanada.mid.ru/pr2007/022.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074427/http://www.rusembcanada.mid.ru/pr2007/022.html|archive-date=11 December 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=2 October 2008}}</ref>

Under Putin, the [[Hasidic]] [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia]] became increasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin, notably [[Lev Avnerovich Leviev|Lev Leviev]] and [[Roman Abramovich]].<ref name="Russia">''No love lost'', Yossi Mehlman, ''Haaretz'', 11 December 2005.</ref><ref>Phyllis Berman Lea Goldman, (15 September 2003).

While from the early 2000s Russia started placing more money into its military and defense industry, it was only in 2008 that full-scale [[Russian military reform]] began, aiming to modernize the Russian Armed Forces and make them significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried out by Defense Minister Serdyukov during Medvedev's presidency, under the supervision of both Putin, as the head of government, and Medvedev, as the commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces.<ref name="military-reform"/>

Key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million, reducing the number of officers, centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres, creating a professional [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] corps, reducing the size of the central command, introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff, elimination of cadre-strength formations, reorganising the reserves, reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments.<ref name="military-reform">{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081017/117787642.html |title=Military reform to change army structure.

According to the Kremlin, Putin embarked on a build-up of [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|Russia's nuclear capabilities]] because of U.S. President [[George W.

New York City-based NGO [[Human Rights Watch]], in a report entitled ''Laws of Attrition'', authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW's Europe & Central Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was reelected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of non-governmental organizations, harassed, intimidated and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the "foreign agents" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/node/115059 "Laws of Attrition: Crackdown on Russia's Civil Society after Putin's Return to the Presidency,"] Human Rights Watch pdf report, 24 April 2013.</ref><ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/russia-worst-human-rights-climate-post-soviet-era Russia: Worst Human Rights Climate in Post-Soviet Era, Unprecedented Crackdown on Civil Society] Human Rights Watch Summary, 24 April 2013.</ref> Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to [[Russian gay propaganda law|"the gay propaganda law"]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/kyrgyzstan-lgbt-community-fear-attacks-russia|title='We'll cut off your head': open season for LGBT attacks in Kyrgyzstan|last=North|first=Andrew|date=4 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 June 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/russia-rise-homophobic-violence|title=Russian anti-gay law prompts rise in homophobic violence|last=Luhn|first=Alec|date=1 September 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 June 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/10/09/russian_lgbt_activists_on_the_effects_of_gay_propaganda_law.html|title=The Chilling Effects of Russia's Anti-Gay Law, One Year Later|last=Keating|first=Joshua|date=9 October 2014|work=Slate|access-date=21 June 2017|issn=1091-2339}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russias-lgbt-youth-victimized-by-gay-propaganda-law-49524|title=Russia's LGBT Youth Victimized by 'Gay Propaganda' Law|access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref>

As of June 2020, per Memorial Human Rights Center, there were 380 political prisoners in Russia, including 63 individuals prosecuted, directly or indirectly, for political activities (including Alexey Navalny) and 245 prosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that are banned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list, i.e. more than 20% of the total, are residents of Crimea.<ref>{{cite web|date=4 October 2017|title=Списки преследуемых|url=https://memohrc.org/ru/content/spiski-presleduemyh|access-date=11 October 2021|website=Правозащитный центр «Мемориал»}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Council|first1=Russian-speaking Community|last2=Inc.|date=14 June 2021|title=Russia's Political Prisoners Directory|url=https://amrusrights.wordpress.com/2021/06/14/russias-political-prisoners-directory/|access-date=11 October 2021|website=American Russian-Speaking Association for Civil & Human Rights}}</ref>

=== The media ===

Scott Gehlbach, a Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], has claimed that since 1999, Putin has systematically punished journalists who challenge his official point of view.<ref>Scott Gehlbach, "Reflections on Putin and the Media". ''Post-Soviet Affairs'' 26#1 (2010): 77–87.</ref> [[Maria Lipman]], an American writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' claims, "The crackdown that followed Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media, which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently."<ref>{{cite news|author-link=Maria Lipman|title="How Putin Silences Dissent: Inside the Kremlin's Crackdown"|publisher=Foreign Affairs|volume=95#1|date=2016|page=38}}</ref> The Internet has attracted Putin's attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information.<ref>Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, ''The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries'' (2015).</ref> Marian K.

Robert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker reported that "[[Reporters Without Borders]], for instance, ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the crackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to vigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered journalists.

In the early 2000s, Putin and his circle began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] tsars who ended Russia's "[[Time of Troubles]]", meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Eve|date=Fall 2011|title=Muscovy and Its Mythologies|journal=Kritika: Explorations in Russian & Eurasian History|volume=12|issue=4|pages=773–788|doi=10.1353/kri.2011.0058|s2cid=159746900}}</ref>

=== Promoting conservatism ===
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Pokrova Church (Turginovo) 03.jpg|thumb|Putin attends the [[Christmas in Russia|Orthodox Christmas]] service in the village Turginovo in [[Kalininsky District, Tver Oblast|Kalininsky District]], Tver Oblast, 7 January 2016]]
Putin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural, and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked [[globalism]] and [[neoliberalism]], and is identified by scholars with [[Russian conservatism]].<ref>Sergei Prozorov,  "Russian conservatism in the Putin presidency: The dispersion of a hegemonic discourse." ''Journal of Political Ideologies'' 10#2 (2005): 121–143.</ref> Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist [[Alexander Prokhanov]], stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia."

''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143–165.</ref>

In cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like "a miracle of God."<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Gerlach|editor-first1=Julia|editor-last2=Töpfer|editor-first2=Jochen|title=The Role of Religion in Eastern Europe Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1F6vBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA135|year=2014|publisher=Springer|page=135|isbn=978-3-658-02441-3}}</ref> Steven Myers reports, "The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions...

Under Putin, the Kremlin has consistently stated that Russia has a [[sphere of influence]] and "privileged interests" over other [[Post-Soviet states]], which are referred to as the "near abroad" in Russia.

A series of so-called [[colour revolution]]s in the [[post-Soviet states]], namely the [[Rose Revolution]] in Georgia in 2003, the [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine in 2004 and the [[Tulip Revolution]] in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia.

Putin opposed any foreign intervention. In June 2012, in Paris, he rejected the statement of French president [[François Hollande]] who called on [[Bashar Al-Assad]] to step down.

He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked "What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading?

=== Polls and rankings ===
The director of the [[Levada Center]], Denis Volkov, stated in 2015 that drawing any conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them to polls in democratic states was pointless as there is no real political competition in Russia, where, unlike in democratic states, Russian voters are not offered any "credible alternatives" and public opinion is primarily formed by state-controlled media which promotes those in power and discredits any alternative candidates.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Opinion: The truth about Putin's 86-percent approval rating.

In democratic countries, politics is based on competition and the constant contestation between different candidates and platforms.

Soon after Putin returned from his KGB service in Dresden, East Germany, he built a [[dacha]] in Solovyovka on the eastern shore of Lake Komsomolskoye on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] in [[Priozersky District]] of [[Leningrad Oblast]], near St. Petersburg. After the dacha burned down in 1996, Putin built a new one identical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who built dachas nearby. In 1996, the group formally registered their fraternity as a [[housing cooperative|co-operative]] society, calling it [[Ozero]] ("Lake") and turning it into a [[gated community]].<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/how-the-1980s-explains-vladimir-putin/273135/# How the 1980s Explains Vladimir Putin.

On 19 January 2021, two days after [[Alexei Navalny]] was detained by Russian authorities upon his return to Russia, a video investigation by him and the [[Anti-Corruption Foundation]] (FBK) was published accusing Putin of using fraudulently obtained funds to build the estate for himself in what he called "the world's biggest bribe." In the investigation, Navalny said that the estate is 39 times the size of [[Monaco]] and cost over 100 billion rubles ($1.35 billion) to construct. It also showed aerial footage of the estate via a drone and a detailed floorplan of the palace that Navalny said was given by a contractor, which he compared to photographs from inside the palace that were leaked onto the Internet in 2011. He also detailed an elaborate corruption scheme allegedly involving Putin's inner circle that allowed Putin to hide billions of dollars to build the estate.<ref name="tmt-putin's-palace">{{cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/19/navalny-targets-billion-dollar-putin-palace-in-investigation-released-after-jailing-a72661|title=Navalny Targets 'Billion-Dollar Putin Palace' in New Investigation|website=The Moscow Times|date=19 January 2021|access-date=19 January 2021|archive-date=19 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119160300/https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/19/navalny-targets-billion-dollar-putin-palace-in-investigation-released-after-jailing-a72661|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://meduza.io/feature/2021/01/19/fbk-opublikoval-ogromnoe-rassledovanie-o-dvortse-putina-v-gelendzhike-vot-glavnoe-iz-dvuhchasovogo-filma-o-stroitelstve-tsenoy-v-100-milliardov|title=ФБК опубликовал огромное расследование о "дворце Путина" в Геленджике.

<!-- === Speculations about mental health ===
The US intelligence psychologist [[Jerrold Post]] from the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior of the CIA assessed Putin to be a "[[Narcissism|narcissist]]", a "brutally ruthless dictator" with "extremely calculating nature", the "meticulous pseudo-legal justifications for his actions". Putin was deemed to be obsessed with "masculinity, size, strength and power" and preoccupied "with size and strength is overcompensation for his underlying insecurity".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jerrold M.|first=Post|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=OqIaBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22Jerrold+Post%22+%22putin%22+narcissism&source=bl&ots=rOwqHHcKS7&sig=ACfU3U2gMkrA-c1p0hkNhSNpSS4tMsVeHw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidvIXCk9D2AhWiSvEDHfrtBJwQ6AF6BAgcEAM#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Narcissism and Politics: Dreams of Glory; Putin the Great|page=219-220|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn= 9781107008724}}</ref> concealing this section per talk, see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vladimir_Putin&oldid=1078878872#Vladimir_Putin#Speculations_about_mental_health. ~~~~.-->

=== Pets ===
{{Main|Pets of Vladimir Putin}}
Putin has received five dogs from various nation leaders: [[Konni (dog)|Konni]], Buffy, Yume, Verni and Pasha. Konni died in 2014. When Putin first became president, the family had two poodles, Tosya and Rodeo. They reportedly stayed with his ex-wife [[Lyudmila Putina|Lyudmila]] after their divorce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aif.ru/dontknows/file/skolko_sobak_u_putina|title=Сколько собак у Путина?|date=23 October 2017|website=aif.ru|language=ru|trans-title=How many dogs does Putin have?|access-date=9 October 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20211009200045/https://aif.ru/dontknows/file/skolko_sobak_u_putina|archive-date=9 October 2021}}</ref>

Putin is [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]. His mother was a devoted Christian believer who attended the Russian Orthodox Church, while his father was an [[atheist]].<ref name="Colton">{{cite book|author1-link=Timothy Colton|title=Popular Choice and Managed Democracy: the Russian elections of 1999 and 2000|url=https://archive.org/details/popularchoiceman00colt|url-access=registration|author1=Timothy J.

His mother secretly baptized him as a baby, and she regularly took him to services.<ref name=sakwa_p3 />

According to Putin, his religious awakening began after a serious car crash involving his wife in 1993, and a life-threatening fire that burned down their [[dacha]] in August 1996.<ref name=Colton /> Shortly before an official visit to Israel, Putin's mother gave him his baptismal cross, telling him to get it blessed. Putin states, "I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since."<ref name=sakwa_p3 /> 

When asked in 2007 whether he believes in God, he responded: "There are things I believe, which should not in my position, at least, be shared with the public at large for everybody's consumption because that would look like [[self-advertising]] or a political [[striptease]]."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071221190115/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1690757_1695787-3,00.html Putin Q&A: Full Transcript] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.
