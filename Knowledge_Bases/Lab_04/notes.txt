Current state:
1) Input-2 is very flat, we need to enlarge it. However, no bad nodes.
2) Input-1: no extremely bad things
    - country linked to all: trade agreement, city, panama
    - liverpool is only a club
    - Creature is higher than animal
3) samples: no bad things:
    - company and person merged
    - company and organization are not merged
    - flat angelina joli

Overall
1. Messy pictures
2. Shallow graphs

DONE
1. Build initial version of graphs based only on provided nodes.

TO FIX
1. Microsoft assigned as country
2. Panama as trade agreement
3. Trade agreement as country
2. Cat-dog taxonomy
3. God as a scientist

TODO
1. Fix error resolution (multiple intersection, fragile now)
2. Extend leave nodes with extra options to make things more generic.
3. Ensure depth 4 (enough for one entity) and num_of_nodes 50.
4. Draw tree-like structure


Observations
1. Donald duck mapped to entity, however, we can derive 'character' or 'disney character'
2. Donald trump mapped to nothing as weell


What I can additionally do:
1. Match based on substrings ('bengalian tiger' -> 'tiger')
2. Get good common hypernyms - count hypernyms over all corpus.

Criteria
1. Correctness
2. Readability
3. Robustness (on input-3.txt)

Advices from tutors:
1. Clean webisalod: remove '+', '_'.
2. Use embeddings in case of close scores (if you want).
