'''Serena Jameka Williams''' (born September 26, 1981)<ref name="WTA profile" /> is an American professional [[tennis]] player. She has been ranked [[List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players|singles world No. 1]] by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She has won 23 [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Tournaments|Grand Slam]] singles titles, the most by any player in the [[Open Era]], and the [[All-time tennis records – women's singles#Grand Slam singles totals|second-most of all time]] (behind [[Margaret Court]]'s 24).

Along with her older sister [[Venus Williams|Venus]], Serena Williams was coached by her parents [[Oracene Price]] and [[Richard Williams (tennis coach)|Richard Williams]]. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the [[1999 US Open – Women's singles|1999 US Open]]. From the [[2002 French Open – Women's singles|2002 French Open]] to the [[2003 Australian Open – Women's singles|2003 Australian Open]], she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Non-calendar-year Grand Slam|non-calendar year Grand Slam]] and the [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|career Grand Slam]], known as the "Serena Slam". The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the [[2012 Wimbledon Championships – Women's singles|2012 Wimbledon Championships]], Williams returned to dominance, claiming [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's singles|Olympic gold]] and becoming the first tennis player to achieve a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Career Golden Slam]] in both singles and doubles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Berkok |first=John |date=4 August 2020 |title=On This Day: Serena completes her Golden Slam at 2012 London Olympics |url=https://www.tennis.com/news/articles/on-this-day-serena-completes-her-golden-slam-at-2012-london-olympics |access-date=28 March 2022 |website=Tennis.com |language=en}}</ref> She won eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the [[2017 Australian Open – Women's singles|2017 Australian Open]], she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing [[Steffi Graf]]'s Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant, and has reached four major finals since returning to play.

Williams has also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair are unbeaten in Grand Slam doubles finals.<ref>{{cite web |last=Neworth |first=Jack |url=http://www.10sballs.com/2012/09/10/almost-serene-serena-by-jack-neworth/ |title=Almost Serene Serena |website=10sballs.com |date=September 10, 2012 |access-date=May 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508062539/http://www.10sballs.com/2012/09/10/almost-serene-serena-by-jack-neworth// |archive-date=May 8, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This includes a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the [[2009 Wimbledon Championships – Women's doubles|2009 Wimbledon Championships]] and the [[2010 French Open – Women's doubles|2010 French Open]], which granted the sisters the [[List of WTA number 1 ranked doubles tennis players|doubles world No. 1 ranking]].

When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]<ref name="Serenabio" /> so she could attend the tennis academy of [[Rick Macci]], who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|title=Venus, Serena reflect as they prepare for Fed Cup|publisher=blackathlete.net|access-date=April 22, 2009|first=Michelle|last=Kaufman|date=April 22, 2007|archive-date=July 8, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708024727/http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|url-status=dead}}</ref> Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.<ref name="Newsweek1998">{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/1012925/venus-serena-against-world |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903121131/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/1012925/venus-serena-against-world |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 3, 2017 |title=Venus And Serena Against The World |first1=Marc |last1=Peyser |first2=Allison |last2=Samuels |date=August 24, 1998 |work=Newsweek |access-date=April 19, 2009}}</ref> At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the [[United States Tennis Association]] junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.<ref name="EdmonsonsEarly">Edmonson, 2005, ''Venus and Serena Williams'', pp. 46–47.</ref> In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."<ref name="EdmonsonsEarly" />

===1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 player===
Williams lost in the third round of the [[1999 Australian Open]] to [[Sandrine Testud]]. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeated [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the final of the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris. With Venus also winning the [[Cellular South Cup|IGA Superthrift Classic]] in Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.<ref>{{cite news |title = Continents Apart, Williams Sisters Make History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/01/sports/tennis-continents-apart-williams-sisters-make-history.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 22, 2009 |date=March 1, 1999 |first=Sal A.|last=Zanca}}</ref> In March of that year, at the [[BNP Paribas Open|Evert Cup]] in California, Williams won her first [[Tier I]] title, defeating [[Steffi Graf]] in the final.

She then defeated in succession Grand Slam champions [[Kim Clijsters]], [[Conchita Martínez]], [[Monica Seles]], and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] final, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, after [[Althea Gibson]] in 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.<ref Name ="WTA profile" /> The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia.

Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to [[Elena Likhovtseva]]. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win the [[Faber Grand Prix]] in Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed the [[2000 French Open|French Open]] because of injury. She returned from injury at the [[2000 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Du Maurier Open]] where an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of the [[2000 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at the [[Sydney Olympics]] that September. She ended the year winning the [[Toyota Princess Cup]] in Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International in [[Medibank International|Sydney]] and the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was the [[Pacific Life Open]] in California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family after [[Boycott of BNP Paribas Open by Venus and Serena Williams|Venus withdrew]] before their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Indian-Wells-boycott-hurts-Williamses-more-than-?urn=ten,149332 |title=Indian Wells boycott hurts Williamses more than it helps |last=Rogers |first=Martin |date=March 19, 2009 |work=Busted Racquet |publisher=Yahoo!

She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both the [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and [[2001 Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]]. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals of [[East West Bank Classic|Los Angeles]] against Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]], defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Tour Championships]], Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final due to a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===2002–2003: "Serena Slam"===
Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at the [[Medibank International Sydney]] and later withdraw from the [[2002 Australian Open|Australian Open]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/14/sports/tennis-agassi-and-serena-williams-withdraw-in-australia-kuerten-is-beaten.html|title=Tennis; Agassi And Serena Williams Withdraw In Australia; Kuerten Is Beaten|last=Clarey|first=Christopher|date=January 14, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref> [[File:SWilliams-SYD-1.jpg|thumb|left|<div style="text-align: center;">Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002</div>]]

Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year in [[State Farm Women's Tennis Classic|Scottsdale, Arizona]], defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,<ref name="WTA profile" /> after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the [[2002 French Open]]. Her first tournament was at [[Family Circle Cup|Charleston]], where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing to [[Patty Schnyder]]. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at the [[WTA German Open|Eurocard German Open]] losing to [[Justine Henin]] in a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Italian Open]], defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/20/tennis1 |title=Hingis may be out to end of year |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 23, 2009 |date=May 20, 2002 |first=Eleanor |last=Preston}}</ref> This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy at [[Court Philippe Chatrier]], Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2002 Wimbledon Championships]], Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.<ref name="WTA profile" /> The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing in the quarterfinals of the [[JPMorgan Chase Open]] in Los Angeles to American [[Chanda Rubin]] and ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win the [[Toyota Princess Cup]] in Tokyo, and [[Anastasia Myskina]] to win the [[Sparkassen Cup (tennis)|Sparkassen Cup]] in Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-end [[WTA Tour Championships|Home Depot Championships]] at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking since [[Althea Gibson]] in 1958 {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.<ref name="WTA profile" /> Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1536384-forget-calendar-slam-surface-slam-almost-as-rare|title=Forget Calendar Slam, "Surface Slam" Almost as Rare |work=Bleacher Report|date=February 20, 2013|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2003 Australian Open]], Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongside [[Margaret Court]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Steffi Graf]]. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joining [[Maureen Connolly Brinker]], Court, Graf, and Navratilova.

During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at the [[Open Gaz de France]] and the [[Sony Ericsson Open]]. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of the [[Family Circle Cup]] to Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at the [[2003 French Open – Women's singles|French Open]], where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/french_open_2003/2967190.stm|title=Williams 'hurt' by jeers |access-date=May 30, 2017|work=[[BBC Sport]]

Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals.

She reached the final without dropping a set, including wins over No. 5, Maria Sharapova, and No. 4, Agnieszka Radwańska, and faced first time Grand Slam finalist [[Angelique Kerber]]. She was considered the heavy favorite to win the title, as she had never lost an Australian Open final or semifinal. She also dominated the head-to-head against Kerber, having lost only once in six meetings and having not lost a set to her in four years. Williams lost the final in three sets and Kerber won her first Grand Slam title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/serena-williams-angelque-kerber-australian-open-final-tennis|title=Angelique Kerber stuns Serena Williams to clinch Australian Open title|last=Mitchell|first=Kevin|date=January 30, 2016|website=The Guardian|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> This marked Williams's first-ever loss in the final of the Australian Open, as well as her first three-set loss in the final of a Grand Slam.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/sports/angelique-kerber-upsets-serena-williams-to-win-australian-open.html|title=Angelique Kerber Upsets Serena Williams to Win Australian Open|date=January 30, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 4, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> She had previously been 6–0 and 8–0 respectively.
[[File:Williams S. WM16 (20) (28339693721).jpg|thumb|Serena at the 2016 Wimbledon, winning her 22nd Grand Slam title]]
The week of February 15 marked Williams's 157th consecutive week ranked No. 1, passing Navratilova's mark of 156 to have the second-longest run in WTA history behind Steffi Graf's 186. She competed in [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] as the No. 1 seed. She reached her first final here since winning in 2001 and before boycotting the event, by defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. She did not drop a set en route to the final. Williams was upset by No. 13 seed Victoria Azarenka, whom she had defeated the last five times the pair had met, in straight sets. This marked the first time since 2004 where Williams lost two consecutive finals. She next played the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]] as the defending champion. She lost in the fourth round to Svetlana Kuznetsova. This marked her first loss here since 2012 and ended her 20 match winning streak in Miami. This was also her earliest exit here since 2000, where she lost in the same round. During the clay court swing, Williams withdrew from Madrid but entered Rome. She beat [[Anna-Lena Friedsam]] and [[Christina McHale]] to progress to the quarterfinals where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to avenge her loss in Miami. She then went on to beat [[Irina-Camelia Begu]] and [[Madison Keys]] to win her 70th career WTA title and to win her first title of the year. This was her third Rome title in four years and fourth overall.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], Williams dropped only one set en route to the final. She defeated [[Yulia Putintseva]] in the quarterfinals despite being five points away from losing. She then beat surprise semifinalist [[Kiki Bertens]] to reach her fourth French Open final where she faced Garbiñe Muguruza in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final where Williams was victorious. The result was not the same as that Wimbledon final as Williams lost to Muguruza in straight sets. With this loss, Williams had lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals for the first time in her career. On top of failing to equal Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams also completed the Career Grand Slam runner-up set with this loss.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At [[2016 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], Williams only lost one set en route to the final where she faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the year. This time, Williams defeated Kerber in straight sets to finally equal Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slams in the Open Era. That was Williams's first Grand Slam title of the year, as well as her 71st career WTA title overall. In what was a brilliant serving performance, Williams only faced one break point in the whole match against Kerber which she saved with an ace. Later that day, Williams partnered with sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon doubles title and 14th doubles Grand Slam title overall, keeping their perfect record at Grand Slam doubles finals intact. On July 24, 2016, Williams withdrew from [[2016 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] citing a shoulder inflammation injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12040/10511583/serena-williams-withdraws-from-rogers-cup-in-montreal|title=Serena Williams withdraws from the Rogers Cup in Montreal|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=July 24, 2016|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> She next participated in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where she was the defending gold medalist in both singles and doubles and was the heavy favourite to retain those titles.

Williams's next tournament was the [[2018 Western & Southern Open – Women's singles|Cincinnati Masters]]. She beat [[Daria Gavrilova]] of Australia in straight sets in the first round, but lost to [[Petra Kvitová]] in the second round in a three-set match that lasted over two hours.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Her next tournament was the 2018 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York, where she was seeded 17th, although ranked 26th in the WTA ranking at the time seeds were determined. She defeated [[Magda Linette]] in the first round, [[Carina Witthöft]] in the second round, her sister and 16th seed Venus in the third round, [[Kaia Kanepi]] in the fourth round, and 8th seed [[Karolína Plíšková]] in the quarterfinals. The match against Plíšková was a rematch of the 2016 US Open semifinal, which Plíšková had won. This was Williams's first win against a player in the top 10 (at the time of the match) since her return from pregnancy. Williams won her semifinal match against 19th seed [[Anastasija Sevastova]] of Latvia, winning a spot in the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles final|women's singles final]] against [[Naomi Osaka]] of Japan which she lost in straight sets. Williams was warned for illegal coaching, penalized a point for breaking her racket, and then penalized a game for verbal abuse of the chair umpire.

===2019: Return to the top 10, injuries, Wimbledon and US Open runner-up===
Williams started her 2019 season at the [[2019 Australian Open|Australian Open]], having not made an appearance at the tournament since winning the 2017 edition. Seeded 16th, she defeated [[Tatjana Maria]], [[Eugenie Bouchard]], and [[Dayana Yastremska]] in the first three rounds, before defeating top seed and world number one [[Simona Halep]] in the fourth. In the quarterfinals, she met 7th seed [[Karolína Plíšková]]. Plíšková won the first set and lead in the second, but Williams took control of the match, winning the second and rapidly taking a huge lead in the third. However, after Williams twisted her ankle while up match point, Plíšková won six consecutive games, saving four match points throughout the set to win the match. This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in [[2014 Australian Open – Women's singles|2014]], and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the [[2013 Australian Open – Women's singles|2013 Australian Open]]). Despite this loss, her ranking climbed up to number 11.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams went on to defeat [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the second round of the [[Indian Wells Masters]] in her 2019 campaign for a third Indian Wells crown. In the third round, viral illness caused her to retire against Spain's [[Garbiñe Muguruza]]. This was the second consecutive year she had exited at this stage. She then sustained a recurrence of a long-term knee injury which caused her to pull out of Miami and Rome after playing one match.

In the semifinals she defeated fifth seed Elina Svitolina, proceeding to the final where she faced 15th seed Bianca Andreescu for the second time in under a month.

She defeated [[Anastasia Potapova]] and [[Tamara Zidanšek]] in the first and second rounds respectively in straight sets, before falling to [[Wang Qiang (tennis)|Wang Qiang]] in three tight sets in the third round.

On the resumption of the WTA Tour following a pause caused by COVID-19, Williams entered the [[Top Seed Open]] as the top seed. Following a tough three-set win over [[Bernarda Pera]] in the first round, Williams faced her sister [[Venus Williams|Venus]] for their 31st WTA match in the second round and came through after dropping the first set.

Williams was seeded 6th at the delayed [[2020 French Open – Women's singles|2020 French Open]] held in cold and heavy conditions in October. After defeating Kristie Ahn in straight sets in the first round, Williams withdrew before her second round match against wildcard [[Tsvetana Pironkova]], citing an achilles injury she had sustained during her semi-final defeat to Azarenka at the US Open. This meant for the first time since 2006, Serena failed to reach a Grand Slam final.

=== 2021: Australian Open semifinal, out of top 40===
Williams started the year by playing the [[2021 Yarra Valley Classic – Singles|Yarra Valley Classic]], where she withdrew prior to her semifinal match against the top seed, [[Ashleigh Barty]] citing a right shoulder injury.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zagoria|first=Adam|title=Serena Williams Withdraws From Australian Open Tuneup Event With Shoulder Injury|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/02/05/serena-williams-withdraws-from-australian-open-tuneup-event/|access-date=February 18, 2021|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Williams is an [[Tennis strategy#Offensive baseliner|aggressive baseliner]], whose game is centred around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Due to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams’ greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the [[2013 Australian Open]], she served a 128.6&nbsp;mph (207&nbsp;km/h) ace in her third round match against [[Ayumi Morita]], which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://time.com/3935300/serena-williams/|title=The Most Exceptional Athlete: Serena Williams|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=25 June 2015|access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref> Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/how-serena-williams-used-the-most-beautiful-service-toss-in-tennis-to-beat-her-sister-venus-at-the-us-open|title=How Serena Williams used the most beautiful service toss in tennis to beat her sister Venus at the U.S. Open|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|last1=Marzorati|first1=Gerald|date=1 September 2018|access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref> Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimising double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/serena-williams-serve-dominates-tennis-wins-served-games-2019-8?r=US&IR=T|title=We asked a physicist to break down Serena Williams' iconic serve|work=[[Business Insider]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Shirley|last2=Hunt|first2=Bob|date=4 June 2021|access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref>

They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the [[2019 US Open (tennis)|2019 US Open]]; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2020/02/28/maria-sharapovas-so-called-rivalry-serena-williams-will-define/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2020/02/28/maria-sharapovas-so-called-rivalry-serena-williams-will-define/ |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Maria Sharapova's so-called rivalry with Serena Williams will define her career – she made sure of that|author=Molly McElwee|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=July 30, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] semifinal round against [[Kim Clijsters]], Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set.

While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a [[foot fault]], resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Serena Williams is fined $10,500 for US Open line judge tirade |work=The Guardian |date=September 14, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-williams-tirade-us-open |access-date=June 5, 2010 |first=Lawrence |last=Donegan}}</ref> During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you!
