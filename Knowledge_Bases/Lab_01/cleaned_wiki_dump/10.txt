In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto right flank to receive ball, and be more involved in build up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto end of his teammates' crosses. > web  url  title Juventus' twin towers of Ronaldo, Mandzukic to provide a unique test for Atletico's stingy defence  publisher ESPN FC  first1 Michael  last1 Cox  date 19 February 2019  access date 30 April 2019 >  name "FreeRole"> web  url  title Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri.
