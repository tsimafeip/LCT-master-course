On July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement which said: "Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive 'per processor' licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f0000/0045.htm |title=Competitive Impact Statement : U.S. v.

In November 2018, the company won a $480&nbsp;million military contract with the U.S. government to bring [[augmented reality]] (AR) headset technology into the weapon repertoires of American soldiers. The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable "25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle", suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/microsoft-wins-480m-military-contract-to-outfit-soldiers-with-hololens-ar-tech/ |title=Microsoft wins $480M military contract to outfit soldiers with HoloLens AR tech |work=TechCrunch |access-date=November 29, 2018 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129072828/https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/microsoft-wins-480m-military-contract-to-outfit-soldiers-with-hololens-ar-tech/ |archive-date=November 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Subsidiaries ===
Microsoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.<ref name="mcan">{{cite web |title=Welcome to Microsoft Canada |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/about/ |publisher=Microsoft |access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref> Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock.

In April 2016, the company [[Microsoft v. United States (2016)|sued the U.S. government]], arguing that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DoJ). The DoJ had "changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information."

Baker stated "The new logo, in [[Helvetica]] italic typeface, has a slash between the ''o'' and ''s'' to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jha |first=Lakshman |date=2008 |title=Customer Relationship Management: A Strategic Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbnZwhUjlF0C |publisher=Global India Publications |page=218 |isbn=978-81-907211-2-7 |access-date=May 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323120123/https://books.google.com/books?id=NbnZwhUjlF0C |archive-date=March 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter ''O'', nicknamed the ''blibbet'', but it was discarded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/larryosterman/remember-the-blibbet |title=Remember the blibbet |work=Larry Osterman's WebLog |publisher=Microsoft |last=Osterman |first=Larry |date=July 14, 2005 |access-date=October 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803222257/http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx |archive-date=August 3, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> Microsoft's logo with the tagline "Your potential.

=== Controversies ===
{{Main|Microsoft litigation|Criticism of Microsoft|}}

Criticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the [[ease of use]], [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]], and [[Computer security|security]] of the company's software. They've also been criticized for the use of [[permatemp]] employees (employees employed for years as "temporary," and therefore without medical benefits), the use of [[forced retention]] tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.<ref>{{cite web |title=Troubling Exits At Microsoft |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502084953/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2007}}</ref> Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a "Velvet Sweatshop", a term which originated in a 1989 ''[[Seattle Times]]'' article,<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Paul |date=April 23, 1989 |title=A 'Velvet Sweatshop' or a High-Tech Heaven? |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1980s/89/890423.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629191556/http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1980s/89/890423.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref> and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.<ref>{{cite web |title=Editor's note, MSJ August 1997 |url=https://www.microsoft.com/msj/0897/ednote0897.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214061859/http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0897/ednote0897.aspx |archive-date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=September 27, 2005 |website=Microsoft}}</ref> This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. 

As reported by several news outlets,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hancock |first1=Ciarán |title=Irish-registered subsidiary of Microsoft records $314bn profit |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/irish-registered-subsidiary-of-microsoft-records-314bn-profit-1.4565525 |access-date=June 3, 2021 |website=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref name="Neate">{{cite web |last1=Neate |first1=Rupert |title=Microsoft’s Irish subsidiary paid zero corporation tax on £220bn profit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/03/microsoft-irish-subsidiary-paid-zero-corporate-tax-on-220bn-profit-last-year?ref=upstract.com&curator=upstract.com&utm_source=upstract.com |access-date=June 3, 2021 |website=The Guardian}}</ref> an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the [[Republic of Ireland]] declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in [[Bermuda]] as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One', a subsidiary that collects licence fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame [[Margaret Hodge]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] in the UK said, "It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business".<ref name="Neate" /> 

In 2020, [[ProPublica]] reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of "nearly 0%." When the [[Internal Revenue Service]] audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |date=2020-01-22 |title=The sordid tale of Microsoft's epic tax evasion and the war they waged against the IRS |url=https://boingboing.net/2020/01/22/clippy-dodges-taxes.html |access-date=2022-02-15 |website=Boing Boing |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kiel |first=Paul |title=The IRS Decided to Get Tough Against Microsoft.
