In April 2016, company Microsoft v. United States (2016) sued U.S. government, arguing that secrecy orders were preventing company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that Fourth Amendment to United States Constitution Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had right to know if government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop lawsuit as a result of a policy change by United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had "changed data request rules on alerting Internet users about agencies accessing their information."
