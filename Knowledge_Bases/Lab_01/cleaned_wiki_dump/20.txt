Modern scholarly opinion largely agrees that these hymns were composed between around 1500&nbsp;BCE and 1200&nbsp;BCE, during eastward migration of Indo Aryan tribes from mountains of what is today northern Afghanistan across Punjab into north India.  url name "Combined 4 Rigveda">(a)  book Witzel Michael  author link Michael Witzel editor Gavin Flood title The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism chapter url Wiley & Sons  isbn 978 0 470 99868 7 pages 68–70 chapter Vedas and Upanisads quote It is known from internal evidence that Vedic texts were orally composed in northern India, at first in Greater Punjab and later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 BCE and ca. 500–400 BCE. The oldest text, Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); ... The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a tape recording of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just actual words, but even long lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to present. (pp. 68–69) ... The RV text was composed before introduction and massive use of iron, that is before ca. 1200–1000 BCE.

The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south east, following course of Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva)."
  />(d) harvnb Dyson 2018 pp [14–15], "Although collapse of Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an ‘Aryan invasion’ it is widely thought that, at roughly same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo Aryan speaking people and influences began to enter subcontinent from north west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into north west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to Indo European language family. ... It seems likely that various small scale migrations were involved in gradual introduction of predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on one hand, and changes in language and culture on other. Moreover, process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as ‘Arya’—was certainly two way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And hymns and stories of Arya people—especially Vedas and later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on history of subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.";   /> (e) harvnb Robb 2011 pp [46–], "The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit speaking elite, or Aryans.

The Indian early medieval age, from CE 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.sfn Stein 1998 p   132 When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of Indo Gangetic Plain from CE 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by Chalukya dynasty Chalukya ruler of Deccan.sfn Stein 1998 pp   119–120 When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by Pala Empire Pala king of Bengal.sfn Stein 1998 pp   119–120 When Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by Pallava dynasty Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by Pandya dynasty Pandyas and Chola dynasty Cholas from still farther south.sfn Stein 1998 pp   119–120 No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.sfn Stein 1998 p   132 During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non traditional ruling classes.sfn Stein 1998 pp   121–122 The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.sfn Stein 1998 pp   121–122

After 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using courser (horse) swift horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north western plains, leading eventually to establishment of Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.sfn Ludden 2002 p   68 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India.

 Modern India 
Main History of Republic of India
Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of James Broun Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of East India Company set stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, surveillance of population, and education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.sfn Robb 2001 pp   151–152sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 pp   94–99sfn Brown 1994 p   83sfn Peers 2006 p   50 However, disaffection with company also grew during this time and set off Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook foundations of Company rule.sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 pp   100–103sfn Brown 1994 pp   85–86 Although rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to dissolution of East India Company and British Raj direct administration of India by British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British style parliamentary system, new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.sfn Stein 1998 p   239sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 pp   103–108 In decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to founding of Indian National Congress in 1885.sfn Robb 2001 p   183sfn Sarkar 1983 pp   1–4sfn Copland 2001 pp   ix–xsfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 p   123

The rush of technology and commercialisation of agriculture in second half of 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on whims of far away markets.sfn Stein 1998 p   260 There was an increase in number of large scale Famine in India famines,sfn Bose Jalal 2011 p   117 and, despite risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.sfn Stein 1998 p   258 There were also salutary effects  commercial cropping, especially in newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 p   126 The railway network provided critical famine relief,sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 p   97 notably reduced cost of moving goods,sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 p   97 and helped nascent Indian owned industry.sfn Metcalf Metcalf 2006 p   126

India accounts for bulk of Indian subcontinent, lying atop Indian Plate Indian tectonic plate, a part of Indo Australian Plate.sfn Ali Aitchison 2005 India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when Indian Plate, then part of southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north eastward Plate tectonics drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south west, and later, south and south east.sfn Ali Aitchison 2005 Simultaneously, vast Tethys Ocean Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduction subduct under Eurasian Plate.sfn Ali Aitchison 2005 These dual processes, driven by convection in Earth's Mantle (geology) mantle, both created Indian Ocean and caused Indian continental crust eventually to under thrust Eurasia and to uplift Himalayas.sfn Ali Aitchison 2005 Immediately south of emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent shaped trough (geology) trough that rapidly filled with river borne sedimentsfn Dikshit  Schwartzberg p 7 and now constitutes Indo Gangetic Plain.sfn Prakash et al. 2000   The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above sediment in ancient Aravalli range, which extends from Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To west lies Thar desert, eastern spread of which is checked by Aravallis.  name aravalli>harvnb Kaul 1970 p 160, "&nbsp;The Aravalli range boldy defines eastern limit of arid and semi arid zone.

On this site, where life giving streams running off most northern spur of rocky Aravalli ridge flowed into Jumna river, and where war horse and war elephant trade intersected, a series of dynasties built fortified capitals." >

Indian cultural history spans more than nowrap 4,500 years.sfn Kuiper 2010 p   15 During Vedic period (Circa BCE 1700 BCE 500), foundations of Hindu philosophy, Hindu mythology mythology, Hindu theology theology and Hindu texts literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as Dharma dhárma, Karma kárma, yoga yóga, and moksha mokṣa, were established.sfn Kuiper 2010 p   86 India is notable for its Indian religions religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among nation's major religions.sfn Heehs 2002 pp   2–5 The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of Upanishads,sfn Deutsch 1969 pp   3, 78 Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Bhakti Bhakti movement,sfn Heehs 2002 pp   2–5 and by Buddhist philosophy.sfn Nakamura 1999

 Visual art 
Main Indian art
India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with rest of Eurasia, especially in first millenium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central Asia Central, East Asia East and South East Asia, last also greatly influenced by Hindu art. >Rowland, 185–198, 252, 385–466 >  Thousands of Indus_Valley_Civilisation#Seals seals from Indus Valley Civilization of third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The "Pashupati" seal, excavated in Mohenjo daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is best known.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 14–16Sfn Harle 1994 pp 17–18  After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.Sfn Harle 1994 pp 17–18Sfn Rowland 1970 pp 46–47 Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious Indian sculpture sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is first imperial movement.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 35–46Sfn Rowland 1970 pp 67–70Sfn Harle 1994 pp 22–24 In first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central Asia Central, East Asia East and South East Asia, last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.Sfn Rowland 1970 pp 185–198, 252, 385–466 Over following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana ("breath" or life force).Sfn Craven 1997 pp 22, 88Sfn Rowland 1970 pp 35, 99–100 This is often complicated by need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on left and right of figures, as with Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 18–19Sfn Blurton 1993 p 151

Most of earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati Stupa Amaravati,Sfn Harle 1994 pp 32–38 or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta Caves Ajanta, Karla Caves Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.Sfn Harle 1994 pp 43–55Sfn Rowland 1970 pp 113–119 In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.Sfn Blurton 1993 pp 10–11 Gupta art, at its peak circa CE 300 CE 500, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at Elephanta Caves.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 111–121Sfn Michell 2000 pp 44–70 Across north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after circa CE 800, though rich with finely carved detail in surrounds of statues.Sfn Harle 1994 pp 212–216 But in South, under Pallava dynasty Pallava and Chola dynasty Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a Chola art and architecture#Sculpture and bronzes sustained period of great achievement; large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 152–160Sfn Blurton 1993 pp 225–227

Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which crowded scenes of court life in Ajanta Caves are by far most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.Sfn Harle 1994 pp 356–361Sfn Rowland 1970 pp 242–251 Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about 10th century onwards, most of earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt style of these was used in larger paintings.Sfn Harle 1994 pp 361–370 The Persian derived Deccan painting, starting just before Mughal miniature, between them give first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and recording of princely pleasures and wars.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 202–208Sfn Harle 1994 pp 372–382, 400–406 The style spread to Hindu courts, especially Rajput painting among Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with smaller courts often most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.Sfn Craven 1997 pp 222–243Sfn Harle 1994 pp 384–397, 407–420 As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.Sfn Craven 1997 p 243Sfn Michell 2000 p 210 In 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw Bengal School of Art, reflecting art colleges founded by British, first movement in modern Indian painting.Sfn Michell 2000 pp 210–211Sfn Blurton 1993 p 211

The earliest literature in India, composed between BCE 1500 and CE 1200, was in Sanskrit language.sfn Hoiberg Ramchandani 2000 Major works of Sanskrit literature include Rigveda (circa BCE 1500 BCE 1200), Indian epic poetry epics  Mahabharata Mahābhārata ( circa BCE 400 CE 400) and Ramayana ( circa BCE 300 and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa ( circa CE 5th century) and Sanskrit Classical poetry Mahākāvya poetry.sfn Johnson 2008sfn MacDonell 2004 pp   1–40sfn Kālidāsa Johnson 2001 In Tamil literature, Sangam literature (circa BCE 600 BCE 300) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is earliest work.sfn Zvelebil 1997 p   12sfn Hart 1975sfn Ramanujan 1985 pp ix–x >citation title Tamil Literature year 2008 encyclopedia Encyclopædia Britannica url February 2022<!   quote Apart from literature written in classical (Indo Aryan) Sanskrit, Tamil is oldest literature in India. Some inscriptions on stone have been dated to 3rd century BC, but Tamil literature proper begins around 1st century AD. Much early poetry was religious or epic; an exception was secular court poetry written by members of sangam, or literary academy (see Sangam literature).  > > From 14th to 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of emergence of Bhakti movement devotional poets like Kabir Kabīr, Tulsidas Tulsīdās, and Guru Nanak Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.sfn Das 2005 In 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by Works of Rabindranath Tagore works of Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,sfn Datta 2006 who was a recipient of Nobel Prize in Literature.
